³36 PARADISE LOST, B. V.

Till tho sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,
ln honour to the world's great Author rise3
Whether to deck with clouds the' unoolour'd sky,

Or wet tho thirsty earth with falling showers‚
Rising or falling, still advance his praise.

His praise, ye winds, that from four quartors blovi,

Breatho sost or loud; and, wave your tops‚ ye pines
With every plant, in sign of worship wave.
Fountains‚ and ye that warblo‚ as yo flow
Melodious murmuro, warbling tune his praise.
Join voices, all ye living souls: yo birds,

That singing up to heaven-gnte ascend,

Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.
Ye that in waters glido, and ye that walk

The earth, and stately troad or lowly creep3
Witness if 1 be silent, morn or even,

To hill or valley, fountain or fresh shade,

Modo iocal hy my song, and taught his praiso.
hail, universal lord, be hountoous still

To give us only good; and if the night

Have gathor'd ought of evil or oonoeal'd,
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark! u

So pray’d they innocent, and to their thoughts
Firm peace recover'd soon, and wonted calm.
