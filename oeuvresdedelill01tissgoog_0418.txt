And limited their might3 though number'd such

h numerous host3 in strength each armed hand
Α legion: led in light, yet leader seem'd

Each warrior single as in chief, expert

Of hattlc3 open when, and when to close

The ridges of grim war: no thought ol llight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed

⁸ That argued lear3 each on himself relied,

hs' only in' his arm the moment lay

Of victory: deeds of eternal fame

Were done, hut infinite; lor wide was spread
That war, and various3 sometimes on firm ground
Α standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,

Tormented all the air3 all air seem’d then

Conflicting lire. Long time in even scale
The battle hung, till Satan, who that day

Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms
No equal‚ ranging through the dire attaclr
Of fighting seraphim confus'd, at length

Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and fell’d
Squadrons at οπεος with huge two-handed sway

Brandish’d alost, the horrid edge came down
wide-wasting3 such destruction to withstand
He hasted, and oppos'd the rocky orb

0f tenfold adamant, his¹ ample shield,

h vast circumference. ht his approach
The great arch-angel from his warlike toil
