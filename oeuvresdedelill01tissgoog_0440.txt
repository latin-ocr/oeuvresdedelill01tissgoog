430 Ptntotsu LOST, Β. Vl.

With silent circumspectiori, unespied.

Now when fair morn orient in heaven appear'd,
Up rose the victor-angels, and to arms

The matin trumpet sung : inerms they stood

Of golden panoply, refulgent host,

Soon handed3 o'thers from the dunning hills

Look roun’d, and scouts each coust light-armed scour,

Each quarter, to descry the distant foe,

Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight,

ln motion or in halt ε him soon they met

Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow

But firm battali0n; back with speediest sail

Zophiel, of cherubim the swiftest wing,

Came flying, end in mid air uloud thus cried:
«Arm, warriors, arm for fight3 the foe ot hand,

Whom ssed we thought, will save us long pursuit

This day3 sear not his ssight3 so thick a cloud

He comes, and settled in hisface Ι see

Sad resolution, and secure ε let each

His adamantine coat gird well, and euch

Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orhed shield,

Borne even or high ε for this day will pour down,

If 1 conjecture ought, no drizzling shower,

But rottling storm ofarrows barb'd with tire„
