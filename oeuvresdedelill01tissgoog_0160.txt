Incens'd with indignation, satan stood
Unterrilied‚ and like a comet hurn'd, ¹
That lires the length of Ophiuchus huge

ln the' aretio sky& and from his horrid hair

Shakes pestilence and war.

Each at the head Ι
Levell'd his deadly aim3 their fatal hands
No eecend stroke intend; and suche frown
Each cast at the’ other, as when two blank clouds,
With Heaven’s artillery fraught, come rattling on
Over the Caspinn, then stand frunt ιο from,
Hoveringa space, till winds the signal blow
Te join their dark encounter in mid air:
- So lrown’d the mightyvcombatants, thet Hell ¹
Gr'ew darker et their frown3 so meteh’d they stood3
For never hut once more was either like
Το meet so great a foe: and now great deeds
llad heen aehiev’d, whereof all 'nell had rung,

llad not the snakyusorcerese that sat
Fast hy Hell-gate, and kept ·the fatal key,

llis'n, and with hideons outcry rush'd between.

α 0 Father! what intends thy hand, she cried,
hgeinst thy only Son? What fury, 0 Son,
Possesses thee, to bend that mortal dart
Against thy Father’s heedl and know'st for wh0m3
