aas Pluaulsu Losa, u. v.

She cruslies, inoffensive must, and meaths
From many aherry, and from sweet kemele press'd

She tempers dulcet ereams : nor'these to hold
Wants her lit vessels pure3 then strows the ground

With rose and odours from the shruh unfum’d.

Meanwhile our primitive great sire, to meet -

His good-like guest, walks forth, without more traiu
Aceompanied than with his own complete
Persections3 in himself was all his state,

More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits

On princes, when their rich retinue long,

Of horses led, and grooms besmear’d with gold,
Dazzless the crowd, and sets them all agape.

Nearer his presence Adam, though not aw'd,

Yet with submiss approach and revereuce meek

As to a superior nature howing low,

Thus said: a Native os heaven, for other place
Nune can than heaven such glorious shape coutaiu;
Since, hy descending from the thrones above,
Those happy places thou hast deign'd a while

To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us
