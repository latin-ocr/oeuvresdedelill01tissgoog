Sleep'stthou, companion dear? What sieep can close
Thy eye-lids? and rememher'st what decree
of yesterday, so late hath pass’d the lips
Of heaven’s hlmighty? Thou to me thy thoughts
Was't wont, 1 mine to thee was wout, to' impart3
Both waking we were one3 how then cen now
Thy sleep dissent? New laws thouseest impos'd3
New laws from him who reigns, new -minds may raise
ln us who serve, new counsels, to dehate

What doubtful may ensue: more in this place
To utter is not safe. Assemble thou

Of all those myriads which we lead the chief 3
Tell them, that by command, ere yet dim night

Her sh'adowy clouds withdraws‚ I am to haste,

And all who under me their hanners ware,

Homeward, with flying march, where we possess

The quarters of the north3 there tho prepare

Fit entertainment to receive our King,

The great Messiah, and his new commende,

Who-speedily through all the hierarchies

Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws. ι)
—So spake the false arch-angel, and infus'd

Bad influente into the' unwary hreast

Of his associate: he together calls,

Or several one by one, the regent powers,

Under him regent; tells, as he was taught,

That the Most High commanding, now ere night,

Now ere dim night had disincumber’d heaven,

The great hierarcha} standard was to move ς
