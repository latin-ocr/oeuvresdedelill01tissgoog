· Terror 31 11333333, though iall'n, intend ethome,
While here shall be our home, what hest may ease
The present misery', and render Hell
lllore tolerahle‚'il there he cure 33 31333333
To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain
Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch
Against a wakelul foe, while l abroad
Through all the coasts 31 dark destruction seek
Deliverance lor us 311 : this enterprise
None shall partake with me. 3

Thus saying rose
The lllonarch‚ and prevented all reply,
Prudent, lest from his resolution rais'd‚
Others among 3133 chief might 31133 now
( Certain to he refused) what erst they lear'd3
And, so refus’d, might in opinion stand
His rivals3 winning cheap the high repute,
Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they
Dreaded not more the' adventure, than his voice
Forhidding; and at once, with him they rose:
Their rising all at once, was as the sound
01 thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend
With awlul reverence prone3 and asa God
Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaveu:

1 Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd‚

That 1333133 general safety he despis’d

His own: 133 neither do the Spirits damn'd
Lose all their virtue3 lest had men should boast

Their speeious deeds on Earth, which glory' excites,
