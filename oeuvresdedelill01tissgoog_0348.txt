338 Pannnrsss LOST, B. V.

On to ,their morning’e rurel work they haste,
Among sweet dews end hovers, where any row
Ἴ Of fruit-trees orer-woody reach’d too far
Their pamper’d houghs, and needed hands to ohech
, Fruitless embraces: or they led the vine
To wed her elm; she spous’d, about him twines
Her marriageahle armo, and with her hringo
Her dower, the adopted cludere, to adom
'nis barren leaves. Them thus employ'd beheld ·
With pity heaven's high King. md to him eall’d
Raphael, the eooiahle spirit, that deign’d
To travel with Tobiae, and secur'd
His marriage with the seven-times·wedded maid.
e Raphael, (said he) thou hear'st what stir on earth
Satan, from hell 'scap'd through the darhsome guli,
Hath rais'd in paradise3 and how disturh'd

This night the human pair3 how he designs

In them at once to ruin all mankind.

Go, therefore, hali this day ae friend with friend ·
Converse with Adam, in what hower or shade
Thou find’st him from the heat ofnoon retir'd,
To respite his day-lahour with repest,

Or with repose3 and such discourse bring on,
hs may adwise him of his happy state,
Happiness in his power left free to will,

Left to his own free will; his will though free,
Yet mutahie3 whence warn him to heware

He swerve not, too secure: tell him withal γ
His danger, and from whom ; what enemy,
