Λ h‘s far as Gods and heavenly oesenees
Can perish: for the mind end spirit remeius
lnvincible, and vigonr soon returns, '
Though all our glory' extinct, and happy stete
Here swellow'd up in endless misery.
But what if he, our conqueror( whom l now
Of force believe Ahnighty, sinee no less
Thansuch could heveo’erpovver’d ench forceas aurs),
Have left us this our spirit and strength entire ’
strongly to suffer and support our pains,
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
Or do him mightier service es his thralls

By right ‘of war, whate’er his bnsiness be,
Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,

Ordo his errands in the gloomy deep?

What can it then evail, though yet we feel

strength undiminish'd, or eternal being

To undergo eternel nlmishment? υ ¹

Whereto with speedy words the' Archfiend replied..
’ aratra Cherub, to be weak is miserante, ¹

Doing er suffering: but of this be sure, ¹

To do ought good never vvffl be our task3

But ever to do ill our sole delight, Ι

hs being the contrary to his high will

Whom we resist. tf then his providence

Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,

Our labour must beto pervent that end,

And out of good still to find meam of evil,

Which oft-times may sueneed, soaspettaps h
