Το Beersaba, where the lloly Land

Borders on Egypt and the’ Arabian shore ;

So wide the opening seem'd, where hounds were set
. To darkness, such as bound the ocean ware.

Satan from hence, now on the lower stair,
That scal’d by steps of gold of Heavengatc,
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
0f all this world et once. hs when ascout,
Through dark and desart ways with peril gone
All night, at last by break of cheerlul dawn
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill,
Which to his eye discovers unawarc
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First seen, or some renown'd metropolis
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorn'd,
Which now the rising sun gilds >with his beante: ,

, Such wonder seiz’d, though after Hearen seen,

The Spirit malign, but much more envy seiz’d,

Ar sight of all this world beheld so fair.

llound he surreys ( and well might, where l1c stood
So high above the circling canopy

Of night's extended shade) frorn eastern point

0f Libra to the llcecy star that bears
Andromedapfarxoff Atlantic scas,

Beyond the' horizon; then from pole to pole

lle views in breadth, and without longer pause
