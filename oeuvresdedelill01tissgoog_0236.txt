Here in the dark so many prociona things
of colour glorious, and effect so rare?

Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazzled; sar and wide his eye commanda,
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,
Bnt all sun-shinc, as when his beams at noon

Culminate from the equatur, as they now

Shot upward still direct, whence no way round
Shadow from body’ opeque can tall: and the' air,
No where so clear, sharpen'd his visunl ray

To objects distant far, whereby he soon

Saw within ken a glorious angel stand,

The same whom John saw also in the Sun:
His back was turn’d, but not his brightnees hid; ι
of beaming snnny rays a goldcn tiar
Circled his head, nor less his looks behind
illustrious¹ on his shoulders, sscdg'd with wings,
Lay waving, round3 on somegreatcharge employ’d
He seem’d, or fix’d in cogitation deep.
Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope
To find who might direct his wan'dering flight
To Paradise, the happy seat'of Man,
His journey's end and our beginning woc}
But first he casts to change his proper shape, ’
Which else might work him danger or delay ι,
And now a stripling cherub he appears, ¹ ι
Not of the prime, yet such as in his iace
Youth smil'd celestial, and to every limb

Suitable grace diffus'd, so well he feign'd.
