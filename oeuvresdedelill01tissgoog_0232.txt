222 raalorss rosi, o. nr.

Down right into tlte world's first region throws
llis ssight precipitant, and winds with ease
Through the pure marble air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable stars, that shone

Stars distant, but nigh hand seem'd other worlds3
Or other worlds they seemâ€™d, or happy isles,

Like those Hesperien gardeus fam'd of old,
Fortunate fields, and grores, and llowery vales,
Thriee happy isles3 but who dwelt happy there

lle staid not to inquire.

above them all
The golden Sun, in splendour likest Hoeven,

Allur'd his eye3 thither his course he bends
Through the calm firmament, ( but up or down,

By contre or eccentrie, hard 'to tell,

Or longitude, ) where the great luminary

Aloof the vulgar constellatione thick,
That from his lordly eye keep distance due,
Dispenses light from lar, they, as they move

Their starry dance in numbers that oompute

Days, months, and years, towards his all-eheering lamp
Turn swilt their various motions, or are turn'd

By his magnetic heam, that gently warms

The universe, and to each inward part

With gentle penetration, though unseen,

Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep3
