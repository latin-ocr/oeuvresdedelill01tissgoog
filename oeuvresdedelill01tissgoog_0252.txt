As great might have aspir'd‚ and me, though mean,
Drawn to his part; but other powers as great

But Heaven's free love, dealt equally to all?

Be then his love aoeurs’d, since loro orbate,

To me alike, it deals eternal woe.

Chose freely what it now so justly rues.

γ hle miserablo! which way shall l ily
