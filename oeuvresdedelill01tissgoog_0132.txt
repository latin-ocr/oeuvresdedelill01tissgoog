122 PthDlSE LOST, B. 11.

Thither let ns bend att our thoughts to leern ·
What creatores there inhabit, oi what monld
Or substance, how indued, and what their power,
hnd where their weakness, how attempted bost, ι
By force or subtlety.

Though heaven be shut,
And Hoeven’s high hrbitrator sit secure
ln his own strength, this place may lie expos’d,
- The utmost horder of his kingdom, left
To their defenee who hold i't: here perhaps
Some advantageous aot may be eohiev’d
By sudden onset3 either with Heli-fine
To waste his whole creation, or possess
hll‘ as our own, and chive, as we were driven,
The puny habitante, or, if not drive,
Seduce thern to our party, that their God
May prove their foe, and with repenting hand
hbolish his own worhs. This would surpass
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
ln our confusion, end our joy uprsioo
In his disturbanee; when his derling sons,
Hurl’d headlong to ponake with us, shall ourse
Their frnil original, and feded bliss,
Faded so soon. Adrise, if this' be worth

Attempting, or to sit in darkness here ’ “

Hatehing vain empires. h
