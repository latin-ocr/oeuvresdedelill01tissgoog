From what point oi his compass to heware
Impetnous winds: he thus began in haste. ἱ

More of the’ Almighty’s works, end chiefly man,

God's latest image: I describ'd his way

Bent all on speed, and mnrk'd his aery gait3

Butin the mount that lies from Eden north,

Where he first lighted, soon discern’d his looks

hlien from heaven, with passion's foul obscnr'd:

Mine eye pursued him still, hut under shade

Lost sight of him: orie of the banish’d crew,

l sear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise

New troubles: hiin thy care must be to find. n

To whom the winged warrior thus return’d :
«Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight,
Arnid the sun’s circle where thou sit'st‚
See sar and wide: in at this gate none pass ’
The vigilance here placed, bu‘t such as corne
Weil known from heaven3 and since meridien honr
No creature thence: is spirit oi other sort, ¹

So minded, heve o'er-leap‘d these enrthl)¹ bounds
