90 niniorsr rosr, o. 1.

Meanwhile the winged heralde, by oommand i
of sov'ran power, with owlhl'oeremony
And trumpet's round, throughout the host proclaim
Α solemn council, forthwith to be held
At Pandemonium3 the high capital
of Satan and his peers: their summons call'd
From every band and squared regiment Ι
By place or choiee the worthieet5 rhemon,
With hundredo 'and with theosinda, trooping reme
Attended: all necess was throng‘d‘r the griffi
And perches wide, hut chief the spacious hall
(Though like a cover'd field, where champions bold
Wont ride in arm’d, and nt'the Soldan's chair
Defied the hest of Panim ehivalry
To morta} combat, or career with lance)
Thiclr swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air
Brush'd with the hies of rustling winge- As bees
In spring-time, when the sun with Taurus rides, ’
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
ln clusters3 they among fresh 'dews and flowers

Fly to andsto, or on the smoothed plank,

l V The suburb of their swan-built eitadel,

New rubb'd with balm, expatiate and confer
Their state-affairs. So thick the aery crowd
Swarm’d and were straiten’d3 till, the signal given,
Behold 3 wonder! · Ι

They but now who seein'd
ln bigness to surpass eerth’s giant sons, ·
