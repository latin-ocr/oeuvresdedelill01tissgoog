292 ’ PARADISE LOST, B. lV.

But whereof all night long shine these? lor whom
This glorious sight, when sleep heth shut all eyes? ιι

Το whom our general ancestor replied:
« Daughter of God and man, accomplish’d Eve, ¹
These have their course to finish round the earth, ,
By morrow evening, and from land to land
ln order, though to nations yet unborn,
Ministering light prepar'd, they set and rise3
Lest total darkness should by night regain
Her old possession, and extinguish lile
ln nature end all things, which these solt lires
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat
Of various influente foment and warm,
Temper or nourish3 or in part shed down
Their stellar virtue on cll kinds that grow
On earth, made hereby apter to receive
Perfection from the sun’s more potent ray.
’ These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,
Shine not in' vain ; nor think, ¹though men were none,
That heaven would want spectatorS, Godwantpraise:

Millions of spiritual creaturos walk the earth

Unseen, both when we wake,'and when we sleep:

All these with ceaseless praisc his works behold
Both day and night ε how oft-en from the steep
Of echoing hill or thicket have weheerd
Celestiel voices to the midnight air,

sole, or responsive each to ¹other's note,
Singing their great Creator! ‘oft in hands
