382· PARADISE LOST, B. V.

Shall bend the linea, and in that honour due
Confess him rightful King? unjust‚ thou say'st‚
Flatly unjust‚ to bind with laws the free,

And equal over equals to let reign,

One over all with unsuceeeded power.
Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute
With him the points of liberty, who made

Thea what thou art, and form'd the powers of heaven·

, Such as he pleas’d, and circumserih'd their being?
ι( Yet, by experiente taught, we know how good,
Andos our good and of our dignity
How provident he is; how far from thought
To make us less, beut rather to exalt
Our happy state, underon head more near
United. But to grant it thee unjust‚
That equal over equals monareh reign:
Thyself‚ though great and glorious, dost thou count,
Or all augelis naturejoin’d iu one,

Equal to him begonem-son? by whom,

As hy his word, the mighty father made .

ml things, eren thee3 and all the spirits of heaven
By him created in their bright degrees,

Crown'd them with glory, and to their glory nam’d
Thronos, dominatione, prineedoms, virtues, powers,
Essential powers3 nor by his reign ohscur'd,

But more illustrious made; since he, the head,

One of our number thus reduc'd heoomes3

His laws our laws; alt honour to him done
Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,
