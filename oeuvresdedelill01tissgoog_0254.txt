244 PARADlSE LOST, Β. lV.

Infinite wreth, ond infinite despair?
Which way 1 fly ishell; myselfam hell;
And, in the lowest deep, e lower deep

Still threatening to devour me opens wide,

To which the'hell l suffer seems a heaven.

e Ο, then, nt last relent ε isthere‘no place
Left for repentanoe, none for pardon left?
None leil, but by submission3 end that word
Disdain forbide me, and my dread of shame
Among the spirits beneoth, whom l seduc'd
With other promises end other vaunts

' Than to submit, boasting 1 could subdue

The' Omnipotent. Ah me l they little know
How dearly 1 abide that hoast eo vain,
Under what tormonte inwnrdly l grean,
While they adore me on the throne of hell.

With diadem and seeptre high advanc'd,
The lower still lsell, only supreme

ln misery: such joy ambition finds !

But say l could repent, and could obtain,

By aet of grece3 my former state; how soon

Would heighth recol high thoughts, how soon unsay
What feign’d submission swore? Ense would recent
Vows made in pain, ee violent end void.
