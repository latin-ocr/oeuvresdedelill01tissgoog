282 Phutnlsu hosi, B. lv.

Α chance but chance may lead where 1 may meet

Some wandecing spirit oi heaven hy toeneio-side,

Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to dinw

What further would be learn'd. Lite while ye may,

Yet happy pair3 enjoy, till 1 return,

Short pleasures‚ for long woes are to succeed. n ’
So saying‚ his proud step he scomful turn’d,

But with sly circumspectiori, and began

Throughwood‚through waste, o'erhill, o’erdale,hisr0am.

Meanwhile in utmost longitude, where heaven

With earth and ocean meets, the setting sun

Slowly descended, and with right aspect ⁴

hgainst the eastern gate of Paradise

Levell'd his evening rays: it was a rock

Of alabaster, pil’d up to the clouds, ,

Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent

hccessihle from earth, one entrance high3

The rest was craggy cliff, that overhung

Still as it rose, impossible to climh. ¹

Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat:

Chias of the angelic guards, awaiting night:

About him exercis'd heroic games

The' unarm'd youth of heaven, but nigh at hand

Celestial armory, shieids‚ heims, and speum,

Hung high, with diamond flaming and with gold.
Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even
On a sun-beam‚ swist asa shooting star

ln autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fir'd
Impress the air, and shows the matinen
