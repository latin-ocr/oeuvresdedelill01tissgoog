aas rauautsu noer, s. vr.

Audin lieres hosting meet, who wout to meet
So oft in festivals ol joy and love

Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,

ι Hymniugthe’ Eternal Father ε but the shout

Of battle now began, and rushing sound
Ol onset ended soon each milder thought.
High in the midst, exalted as a God,

, The' Apostate in his suu-bright ehariot sat,

, ldol of majesty divine, enclos'd

With flaming Cherubim, aud goldeu shields;
Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, lor now
·Twixt host and host but narrow space was lest,
Α dreadful interval, and front to front
⁵ Presented stood in terrible array
Ol hideous length: before the cl'oudy van,
On the rough edge of battle ere it join’d,
Satan, with vast and haughty strides advane’tl,
Came towering, arm'd in adamant and gold3
Abdiel that sight endur’d not, where he stood
Among the mightiest, benten highest deeds,
And thus his own undaunted heart explores:

α Ο heaven! that such resemblance ol the llighest
Should yet remain, where laith and reality
Remoin not: wherefore should not strength and might

There fail where virtue lails, or weakest prove

Ι Where boldest, though to sight uneonquerable?

His puissunee, trustiug in tbe’ Almighty's aid,
Ι mean to try, whose reason l have tried
Unsound and false; nor is it ought but just,
