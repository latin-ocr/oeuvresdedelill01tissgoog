184 PhllADlSE LOST‚ B. lll.
Cut ott, and for’ the book of knowledge fair

Presented with 3 universal blank
Of Nature’s works‚ to me expung’d and ras'd,
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut oute

So muoh the rather thou, celestial light,

Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
lrradiete3 there plant eyes, all mist from thence
Purge and disperse, that l moysee and tell

Ol things invisible to mortal sight. ’

Now had the' Almighty Father from above,

From the pure empyreon where he sits .

High thron'd above all heighth‚ bent down his eye,
llis own works and their works at once to view.
About him all the sanctities of Heawen

Stood thick as stars, and from his sight eeceiv'd
Beatitude past utteranoe3 on his right

The radiant image of his glory sat,

His only Son3 on earth he first behold

ι Our two first parents, yet the only two

. , Ol mankind, in the happy gordon plae'd‚

Reaping immortal fruits of joy, and love,
