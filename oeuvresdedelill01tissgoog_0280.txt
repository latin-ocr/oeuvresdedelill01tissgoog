Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge

On you, who wrong me not, for him who wrong’d.

And should l at your harmless innocense

Melt, as Ι do, yet public reason just,

Honour and empire with revenge enlarg’d,

By conqueririg this new world, compels me now
To do what else, though damn’d, 1 should ahhor. n

So spake the fiend3 and with necessity,
The tyrant's plea, excus'd his devilish deeds.
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree
Down he alights among the sportful herd
of those four-footed kinds, himself now one,
Now other, as their shape serv’d hest his end,

Nearer to view his prey, end uncspied,

· To mark what of their state he more might learn,

· By word or action mark'd: about them round
Α lion now ho stalks with fiery glare3

Thon as a tiger, who hy chance hath spied

In some purlieu two gentle lawns at play,

‚ Straight couches close, then rising, changes ol't

His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground,
Whence rushing he might surest seize them both
