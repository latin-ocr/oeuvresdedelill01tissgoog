And thence tn Hoeven eall’d sotto, with bold words
Breaking the hottid thome,- thus began.

Nor what t'he poteht vic‘tor in his hege

And high distein, from sense of injur’d merit,
That with the Mightiest rais'd me to. contend,
And to the fierce contention brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d,
. That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,
His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd
In dubious battle on the pleins of Heaveh‚
And shook his throne. What though the field bo lost?
Alt is not lost ε the' unconquerable will,
And study of revenge‚ immorati hate,
And comagenem to submit or yffi, v
And what is etse not to be overcome3
That glory never shall his whath or might
