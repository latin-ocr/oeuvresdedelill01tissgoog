’ And Ida known, thence of the suowy top

0f cold Olympus, rul'd the middle air,

Their highest Heaven3 or on the Delphian clilf
Or iu Dodona, and through all the bounds

of Dorio land: or who with Saturn old

Fled over Adria to the’ Hesperian fields,

And o’er the Celtic roam’d the utmost isles.

All these and more came lloclriug3 ¹3¹⁸ with looks

Downcast and damp, yet such wherein appear? d .
Obscure some glimpse ofjoy, to' have found their chief
. Not in despair, to¹ have found themselves not lost .
ln loss itself, which on his countenance cast

Like doubtful hue: but he, his wonted pride
Soon recollectiug, with high words, that hore

ἵ Samhlance of worth, not substance, gently rais'd
Their faiuting courage, and dispell’d their fears.
Then straight commauds, that at the warlike sound
of trumpets loud and clarioris lte. uprear'd

llis mighty standard, that proud honour claim'd
Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall;

Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurl’d
The 'imperial ensign, which, sull high advanc’d,
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,

With gems and golden lustre rich imblaz'd,
Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while
Souorous metal hlowiug martial sounds:

tt which the universal host up·sent

Α shout, that tore Hell's concavo, and beyond ,
Frighted the reign of Chaos aud old Night.
