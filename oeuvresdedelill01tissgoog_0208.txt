198 PARADISE LOST, B. lll.

hecount rue ruam I for his sake will leave
Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee
Freely put off, and for him lastly die

Well pleas'd; on me let death wreah ull his rege,
Under his gloomy power 1 shall not long

Lie vanquish’d3 thou hest given me to possess
Lile in myself lor ever3 by thee I live,
Though now to death I yield, and am his due,
All that of me cun diet yet, thet debt prid,
Thou wilt not leave me in the loetlnome grave
- His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul

For ever with corruption there to ‹lwell3

But 1 shall rise victorious, and subdue

My vanquisher, spoil'd of his vaunted spoil;

Death his death’s wound shall then receive, and stoop

lnglorious, of his mortal sting disarm’d.

l through the ample air iu triumph high

Shall lead hell captive, maugre hell; and show
The powers of darkness bound. Thou, at the sight
Pleas’d, out of heaven shalt look 'down and smile,
While, by thee rais’d, Ι ruin all my foes,

Death last, and with his earoass glut the gravet
Then, with the multitude of my redeem’d, 1

, Shall enter heaven, long absent, end return,
