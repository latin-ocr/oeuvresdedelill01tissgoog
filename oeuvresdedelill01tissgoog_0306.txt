296 PARADISE LOST, B. tv.
Espoused Ere deok'd first her nuptial bed3

And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung,
What day the genial angel to our sire

Broughther, in naked beauty more adorn’d   ¹ ,

More lovely, than Pandora, whom the gods
Endow’d with all their gifts, and Ο too like
ln sad event, when to the' unwiser son
of Jephet brought by Hermes, she ensuer'd
Mankind with her fair looks, to be eveng'd
On him who had stole Jore’s authentie' fire.

Thus, et their shadylodge arriv'd, both stood,
Both turn’d, and under open sky edor’d Ι
The God that made both sky, air, earth, end heaven,
Whichthey beheld, the moon's resplendent globe,

And starry pole t α Thou also mad'st the night, ’

Meker Omnipotent lpand thou the day,
Which we, in our appointed work employ'd,
Hare finish'd, happy in our mutual help

And mutual love, the erown of att our biiss
Ordain'd by thee, and thir delicious place
For us too large, where thy abundante wants
Partakers, end unoropt falls to the ground.

But thou hest prornis'd from us two eruce
To fin the earth, who shell'with ue extol ·
