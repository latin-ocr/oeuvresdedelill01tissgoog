300 rintorsntosr, B. 1v.
Here love his goldcn shafts employs‚ herc lights ·

His constant lamp, and wavcs his purple wings3
Rcings here and revols3 not in the bought smile
of harlots, lovelem, joyless, uncndear'd‚
Casual fruition; nor in court-amours‚

Mix'd donce, or wanton mask‚ or midnight hall,
Or serenate, which the started lover sings

To his proud fair, best quittcd with disdain.

‘ These, lull’d hy nightingales, embracing 'slept‚

⁵ And on their naked limbs the ssowcry roof
Showcr'd rocos, which the mo'rn repair'd. Slcep on,
Blest pair3 and Ο yet happiest‚ if ye seck

No happicr state, and know to know no more!

Now and night measur’d with her shadowy conc
Half way up hill this vast sublunar mult,
And from their ivory port the cherubim,
Forth issuing at thc' accustom'd hour, stood arm'd
To their night-watches in warlike parade3
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spelte.
<t Uzziel, half these drow off, end coast the south
With strictest watch3 these other wheel the north;
Our circuit meets full west. υ As fleme they part,
Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.
From these, two strong and subtle spirits he call’d

That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.
