264 PARADISE LosT, B. w.

With shows instead, mere shows of seeming pure,
And hanish’d from man's life his happiest life,
Simplicity and spotless innocence!

So pass’d they naked on, nor shunn'd the sight
Of God or ange13 for they thought no ill:
So hand inhand they pass'd, the loveliest pair
That ever since in love's embraces met3
Adam the goodliest man of men since born
His sonS, the fairest of her daughters Eve,

Under a tuft of shade that on agreen

Stood whispering soft, by asresh sonutam-side ,
They sat them down3 and, after no more toi}

of their sweet gardening labour, thansuffic'd

To recommend cool zephyr, and made ease

More easy, wholesome thirst and appetite

More grateful, to their supper-fruits they fell;

Nectarine fruits‚ which the compliant boughs
Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline
