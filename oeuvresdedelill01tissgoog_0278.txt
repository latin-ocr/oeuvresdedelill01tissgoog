268 PARADlSE LOST, B. tv.

α Ο hell! what do mine eyes with grief behold l
lnto our room of bliss thus high advenc'd
Creeturcs of other mould, earth-horn perhaps,
Not spirits, yet to heavenly spirits bright
Little inferior3 whom my thoughts pursue
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines
ln thern divine resemblance, and such grace

' ᾖ The hand that form'd them on their shape heth pour'd.
Ah! gentle pair, ye little think how nigh

Your change approaches, when all these delights

Will vanish, and deliver ye to woe;

More woe, the more your teste in now ofj0y3
Happy, hut for so heppy ill secur’d

Long to continue, and this high seat your heaven,
Ill fenc'd for heaven, to keep out such a foe

As now is enter’d; yet no purpos’d foe

Το you, whom l could pity thus forlorn,
Thongh l unpiticd: league with you l seek,

And mutual amity, so strait, so close, y
That l with you must dwell, or yon with me

Henceforth3 my dwelling haply may not please, y
Like this fair Paradise, your sense3 yet such

hccept your Maker’s work: he gave it me, ι

Which l es freely give3 hell shall unlold,

To entertain you two, her widest gates,

And send forth all her kings3 there will he roem,

Not like these narrow limits, to receive

Your numerous osl'spring 3 ·is no better place,
