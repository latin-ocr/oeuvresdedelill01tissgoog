112 PARADISE LOST, B. 11.

For happy though hut 111, for ill not worst,
1f we procure not to ourselves ruore woe. a

Thus Belial , with words cloth’d in reason's garh,
Counsel’d ignohle ease, and peaceful sloth,
Not peace: and aiter him thus Memmon spake.
α Either to disinthroue the King of Hoeven
¹ We war, if war be best, or to regaiu
Our owu right lost ε Him to umbrone we then
. May hope, when everlasting Fato shall yield

To fickle Chauco, and Chaos judge the strife:
The former, vain to hope, argues as vain

· The lattert sor what plaoe can be sor us

within Heaveu's bounds‚ unless Heaveu's Lord Supremo
We overpouer? Suppose he should relent,
And publish grace to 311, on promise made

-Os new subjeoti0n3 with what eyes eouid we
Stand iu his „presence humble‚ and reoeive
Strict laws impos'd‚ to celebrate his throne
With warbled hymus, and' to his Godhead sing
rores halleluiah„ white he rordry sus

Our envied sovrau, and his altar breathes
Ambrosial odours and arubrosiul ssowers‚

'Our servile offerings? This must be our task
ln Heaven, this our delight! how wearisome
Eternity so spent, in worship paid

To whom we hate! Lot us not then pursue '
