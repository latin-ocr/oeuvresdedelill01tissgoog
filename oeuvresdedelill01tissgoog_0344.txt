Speak, ye who best ean tell, ye sons ol light,
hugels; for ye behold him, eud with eongs
hnd‘eborul symphonies, day without night, ’
Circle his throne rejoieing3 ye in heaven,

On earth join all ye creaturos to extol

llim first, him last, him midst, aud without end.
Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,

If better thou belong not the dawn,

Sure pledge of dey, that crown'st the smiling morn
With thy bright eirelet, praise him in thy ephere,
While day arises, that sweet bour of prime.

a Thou eun, of this great world both eye and soul,
Aeknowledge him thy greater, sound his praise
ln thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st,
hnd when high uoon hest gain'd, and when thou fall'st.
Moon, that now meet’st the orient sun, now ssy’st,
With the fix'd stare, fix’d in their orb that ssies3
hnd ye fiveother wandering fires, that move
ln mystic dance not without song, resound
llis praise, who out of darkness eall'd up light.

Of nature's womb, that in quartenion run
Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix
hnd nourish all thinget let your ceaseless change
Vary to out great Mulier still new preire.
Ye miste eod exhalatione, that now riee

From hill or streaming lalre, dusky or gray,
