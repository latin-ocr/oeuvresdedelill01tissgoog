100 Ptthntst LOST, B· 11.

Turning our torturas into horrid arms
hgainst the torturer3 when to meet the noise

0f his almighty engine he shall hear
Infernal thunder3 and, for lightning, see

Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among his ange1s3 and his throne itself

Mix’d with Tartarean' sulphur, and strange fire,

His own invented torments.

But perhaps
The way seems difficolt, and steep to scale
With upright wings against a higher foe.
Let such bethink them, is the sleepy drench
Of that forgetful lake benumh not stili,
That in our proper motion we ascend
Up to our native seat= descent and fatl
To us is adverse. Who butielt of iate,
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
insulting, and pursued us through¹ the deep,
Ι With what compulsion and laborious ssight
We sunk thus lo‘wi’ The' assent is easy then; -
The’ event is fear'd3 should we again provoke
Our stronger‚ some worse way his wrath may find
To our destruction; it there he in Hell Ι
Ι Fear to be worse destroy’d. What can be worse
Than to dweli here, driven out from bliss‚ condemn'd

, ” In this abhorred deep to ,utter woea

Where pain of dnextingttishahie tire
Must exercise us, without hope oi end,
