224 PARADJSE LOST, B. ills
So viondrously was set his 'station bright. Ι

There lends the Fiend, a spot lite which perhaps Ι

Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb
*Through his glaz’d optio tube yet never saw.

The piace he found beyond expression bright,
Compar'd with aught on earth, metal or stone5
Not 311 parts like, but all alike inform'd
, With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire3
If metal, part seem’d gold, part silver clear3
11 stone, carbunele most or chrysolite,

Ruhy or topaz‚ to the twelve that shone

111 Aaron’s breast-plato, and 3 stone besides
Imagin'd rather oft 111311 elsewhere seen,
1131110113, or like to that, which here beiow¹
'Philosophers in vain so long have sought,
11113111, though by their powerful art they bind
Volatile Hermes, and eall up unbound ’
111 various shapes old Proteus from the sea,

Drein'd through a limbee to his native form.¹

What wonder then 11 field 31111 regions here
Breathe forth elixir pure, and rivers run
Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch
The* arch-chymie Son, eo 131 from us remote,
Produces, with terrestial humour mix’d}
