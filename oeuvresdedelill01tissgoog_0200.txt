190 PARAD1SELOST‚·B. ιιι.

l form’d them free: and free they must romain ,

Till they inthral thernselves3 I else must change
Their nature, and revoke the high decree
Unchangeahle, eternal, which ordain’d

Their freedom3 they themselves ordain'd their sall.
The first sort by their own suggestion fell,
Seli-tempted, sels-deprav’d: Man falls, deceiv’d

By the’ other first: Man therefore shall lind grace,
The other none: in anerey and justice both,
Through heaven and carth, so shall my glory' excel;

¹ But morey, first and last, shall brightcst shine. ν

Thus while God· spele, ambrosial fragrance fill'd
hll heaven, and in the hlessed Spirits elect
Sonse of new joy ineffahle diffus'd.

Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
Most gl'orioust in him all his' Father shone
Substantially express'd3 and in his lace
Divino compassion visibly appear'd‚

Love without end, and without measure grece,
Which uttering‚. thus he to hia Tather spake:

«Ο Fathe‘r! gracious was that word· which clos’d
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should lind grace3 ι
For which both heaven and earth shall high extol
Thy praises‚ with the innumerable sound

of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne

lncompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.
For should man finally he lost, should man,
Thy creature late so lov'd‚ thy yongest son,
