Lay floating many a rood, in bulk ‚es hugo
As whom the fables neme of monstrous sizo,
Theman, or Barth-horn, that warr'd on Jovo3
Briareus or Typhon, whom the den
By ancient Tarsus held; or thet sea-beast
Leviethan, which God of all his works
Created hugest that swim the’ ocean stream:
Him haply, slumbering on the Norway soem,

Ι The pilot of some small night-founder’d skilf
Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,

With fixed anchor in his seely rind

Moors by his side under the loe, while night
Invests the sea, and wished monn delays:

So stretoh’d out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay

“ Chain'd on the burning leke3 nor ever thence
Had risen, or lieav'd his head3 but that the will
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
Left him et large to his own dark designs; '
That with reitereted crimes he might

Hesp on himself damnatiom while he sought

Evil to others3 ond, enreg'd, might see

How all his mnlice serv'd but to bring forth

Infinite goodness‚ grece and morey, shown ¹ '

On man by him seduc'd; but on himself

Treble confusion, wrath and sengeance pour'd.
Forthwith upright he neers from off the pool

ssis mighty stature3 on each hand the flames,

Driven haekwerd, slope their pointing spires, and roll’tl
ln billows‚ leave i' the’ midst ahorrid vale.
