428 PARADISE [osi. B. Vl.
impossible ε yet, haply, of thy race Ι , ’
ln future days, if melico should abound,
Some one intent on mischief, or'inspir'd

With devilish machination, might devise
Like instrument to pingue the sons of men

For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.

Forthwith from council to the work they ssew,
None arguing st00d3 innumerahle hands
Were ready 3 in a moment up they turn'd
Wide the celestial soil, and saw beueath
The’ originals of nature in their crude
Concepti0n3 sulphureus and nitrous soem
They found, they mingled‚ and with subtle art .
Concoeted and adjusted, they redue’d
To blackest grain, and into store eonvey'd :
Part hidden veins digg’d up (nor hath this earth

Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,

Whereof ιο found their engines and their balls

of missive ruin; part incentive reed
Provide, pernicious with one touch ιο fire.
So all ere day-spring, under conseious night,
Secret they finish'd, and in order set,
