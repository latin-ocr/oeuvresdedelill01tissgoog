diii PARADISE LOST, Β. V.

«High matter thou enjoin’at tue, 0 prime oi meu,
Sad task and hard: ior how shall 1 relate
To human sense the' invisible exploits
· of warring spirits? how, without remorsa,
The ruin of so many glorious once ’
and perfect while thoy¹ stood? how last unfold
The seorets of another world,‘perhaps
Not lawsul to reveal? yet for thy good
This is dispens'd3 and what surmounts the reach
Of human sense, lshall delineate so,
'By likening spiritual to oot'poreal forms,
As may express them best3 though what if earth
Be but the shadow of heaven, and things therein
Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?

«As yet this world was not, and chaos wild
Reign'd where these heaveos nowroil,wbere earth now rests
Upon her centre pois'da when on a day
(lior time, though in eternity, applied
To motion, mensures ali things duruble
By present, past, and future,) on suth day
As heaven's great year brings forth the’ empyrea! host
Oiangels byimperial summoue call’d,
Innumerable before the Almighty's throne
Forthwith, from all the ends of heaven appear'd
Under their hierarch in orders brightz
Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advauo'd,
Standards and gonsolons 'twixt van and rear

Stream in tho air, and ior distinction serve
