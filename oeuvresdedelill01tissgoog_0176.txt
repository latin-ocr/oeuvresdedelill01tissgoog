166 PARADISE Los·r‚ B. 11.

Into this wild abyss the wary Fiend 0
Stood on the brink of Heli, and look’d a while,
Pondering his voyage τ for no narrow frith
He hed to cross. Nor was his ear less peal’d

With noises loud and ruimus, (to compare

orm uiigswiu matthian when nertonastorms,

· With all her hattering engines bont to raso
Some capital city ; or less then if this frume
0f Hoeven were falling, and these elemento

ln mutiny had {hom her axle torn

The stedihst Earth. At last his soil-broad vans

He yspreeds for ssight, and in tho surging smoke

Uplifted spurns the ground3 thence many a leugue² ,
As in acloudy cheir, ascending rides

Audacious3 hut, thet seat soon failingy meets

Arast vacuity ε all unewares

Flutteriny his pennons rain, plumb down ho dropa

Ten thousand fithom deep 3 and to this hour

Down had been falling, had not hy ill chance

The strong rehuff' oi some tumultuous cloud,¹ 1
Instinct with iire and niue, hurried him Ι ’

hs many miles alost: thet fury maid,

Quenoh'd in a hoggy syrtis, neither sea,

Nor good dry land ι nigh founder'd on he feres,

Troading the crude consistence, half on foot‚

Half flying; behoves him now both oar aud seii.
