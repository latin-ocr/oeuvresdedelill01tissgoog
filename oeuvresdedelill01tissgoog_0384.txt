Tells the suggested muse, and oasts between

Ambiguous words and jealousies, to souud

Or taint integrity ε but all obey’d

The wonted signal, und superior voice

Of their 'great Potentate; for great indeed

llis name, and high was his degree in bearem
llis countenauee, as the morning-star that guides
The starry klock, allur'd them, and with lies
Drew after him the third part of beaven's host.
Meanwhile the eternal eye, whose sight discerus
Abstrusest thoughts, lrom forth his boly mount,
hnd from within the golden lamps that burn
Nightly before him, saw without their light
Rebellion rising; saw in whom, how spread
Among the sons of morn, what multitudes
Were banded to oppose his high deorse,

And, smiling, to his only son thus said.

—- s Son, thou in whom my glory l behold
ln full resplendeuce‚ heir of all my might,
Nearly it now conserus us to be sure
of our omnipotence, an with what arms
We mean to hold what anciently we claim
Of deity or empire: such a foe

Is rising, who intends to' erect his throne

Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north 3
Ἴ Nor so content, bath in bis thought to try

ln battle, what our power is, or our rigbt.

Let us advise, and to this hazard draw·
