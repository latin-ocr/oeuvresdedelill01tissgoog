250 PARADISE LOST, B. lV.
All sadness but despair: now gentle galee,

Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispenso

Nutives persumes, and whispor whence they stole
Tuose balmy spoils. As when to them who sail
Beyond the Cape of ssope, and now ate past
Mozambic‚ off at sea nonth-east winds blow

Sabeon odours from the spicy shore

Of Artby the blest3 with such delay

Well pleas’d they slaok* their course, und many a lenguo
Cheer’d with the grateful smell, old Ocean smiles: ,
So entertoiu'd those odorous sweets tho Fiend,

Who cume their hane: though with them better ploes¹d

Thon Asmodeus with the fishy sume,

That drove him, though enamour'd‚ from the sponse
ι Of Tohit’s son; and with a wengeance sent
From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.

Now to the' ascent of that steep satage hill
Satan had journey'd on, pensiwe ond slow;
But further way found none3 so thick entwin'd

hs one continued brake, the undergrowth
0f shrubs and tnngling bushes hod perplex’d
All path of man or bean thot pass'd that way.
