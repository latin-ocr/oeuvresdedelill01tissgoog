'23¹2 PARADISE LOST, B. ltl.·

a Fair angel, thy desire, which tends to know
The works of God, thereby to glorify
The great Work-master, leads tono excess
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither
From thy empyreal mansion thus alone:
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps,
Contented with report, hear only’ in Heaven,
For wonderful indeed are all his uorks, '
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all
Had in remembrance always with delight;
But what created mind can comprehend
Their number, or the wisdom infinite
That brought them forth, but hid their causes deepi‘
I saw when at his word the formIess mass,
This world's material mould, came to a heap:
Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar
Stood rul’d, stood vast infinitude confined;
Till at his second hidding darkness ssed, ¹

lig-ht shone, and order from disorder sprung: .

Swift to their several quartcrs hasted then

The cumbrous elements, earth, ssood, air, fire;¹
And this etherial quintessence of Heaven

Flew upward, spirited with various forms,

That roll’d orbicular, and turn’d to stare ’

Numbcrlcss, as thou seest, and how thoy move:
