204 ulnamsa hosv, a. 111.

Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Mun,
Anointed universal King3 all power

Ι give thee; reign for ever, and assume

Thy merits3 under thee, as head supreme,
Thrones‚ Princedoms, Powers‚ Dominions 1 reduce ³.
All knees to thee shall bow, ol them that bide η
ln heaven, or earth, or under earth in hell.
When thou, attended gloriously from heaven,
Shalt in the sky appear, aud from thee send
The summoning arch-angels to proelaim

Thy dread tribunal: forthwith lrom all winds,
The living, and forthwith the cited dead

Ol all past ages, to the general doom

Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.

Then, all thy saints assembled, thou shalt judge
Bad men and Angels3 they, arraign’d, shall sink
Beneath thy sentence : Hell, her numbers full,
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Meanwhile
The world shall burn, and from her ashes spring
New heaven and earth, wherein the just shall dwell,
’ And, alter all their tribulations long,

See golden days, fruitlul of golden deeds,

With joy and love triumphing, and fair truth.

T hen thou thy regal sceptre shalt lay by,

For regal sceptre then ηρ more shall need,
