174 PARADISE LOST, Β. ll.

Into the wild expanse3 and through the shoch
Of fighting elemento, on all sides round
Environ’d‚ wins his way; harder beset
And more endanger'd than when Argo pass'd
Througb Bosporus, betwixt the justling rocks:
Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunn'd
Charybdis, and by tbe' other whirlpool steer'd.
So he with difficulty and labour hard
Mov'd on, with difficulty and lebour he;
But, he once past, soon after, when man fell,
Str-ange alteration! Sin and Death amun
Following his trech, such was the will of heaven,
Pav'd after bima broad and beaten way
Over the dark abyss, whose boiling guli
Tamel'y endur’d a bridge of wondrous length,
From Heli continued reaching the' utmost orb
Os this srail world3 by which the Spirits perverse
With easy intercourse pass to and fro

, Το tempt or punish‘mortals,'except whom

God, and good angele guard by special grace.

But now at last the sacred influente

of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven ·
Shoots sar into the bosom os dim Night
Aglimmering dawn. Here nature first begins
Her lardrest vergo, and Chaos to retire

hesrom her outmost works‚ a broken foe

With tumult less, and with less hostile din,

That Satan with loss toil, and now with ease
Wafts on the calmer ware by dubious light,
