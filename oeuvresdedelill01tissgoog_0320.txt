Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither ·
Unlicens’d from his heunds in hell prescrib'd3
So wise he judges it to fly from pain

Which thou incurr’st by ssying, meet thy ssight
Sevenfold‚ and scourge that wisdom back to hell,
Which taught thee yet no better, that uo pain
Can equal anger infinite provok’d.

Came not all hell hmke leuse? is pain to them
Lcss pain, less te he ssed3 or thou than they
Less hardy to endure! Courageous chief!
The first in ssight from pain? hadst thou alledg'd
To thy deserted host this cause of ssight
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. »

Το which the fiend thus auswer'd, frowning stern:
α Not thatl less endum, or shriuk from pain,
Insulting angel! well thou know'st l stood
