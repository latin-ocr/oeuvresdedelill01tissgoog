422 PARADlSE LOS'T, B‘. VI.
Honour, dominion, glory end renown3

Who have sustein'd one day in doubtful fight,
( And if one day, why not eternal days?)

What heaven’s Lord had powerfullest to send
Against us from about his throne, and judg'd
Sufficient to subdue us to his will,

But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,

Of future we may deem him, though till now
Omniscient thought. True is, less hrmly arm'd,
Some disadvantege we endur'd and pain,

Till now not known, but, known, assoon contemn'd;
Since now we find this our empyresl form ·
lncapable of mortal injury,

lmperishable, end, though pierc’d with woun'd
Soon closing, and by native vigour heel'd.

' Of evil then so small as easy think

She remedy; perhaps more valid arms,
Weapons more violent, when next we meet,
May serve to better us, and worse our foes,
0r equal what between us made the odds,

ln nature none: if other hidden cause

Left thern superior, while we ean preserve
Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,

Due search and consultation will disclose. n ’

He sat3 and in the assembly next ups'tood

Nisroch, of principalitios tho prime3
