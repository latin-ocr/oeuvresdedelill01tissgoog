392 PhllthSE LOST‚ B. Vl.

Obsequious Darkuess enters, till her honr

To veil the heavensthough darkness there 'might well
Seem twilight here: and now went forth the Moru
Such as in highest heaven array’d in gold
Empyreal; from before her vanish'd Niglrt,

Shot through with orient beams3 when all the plain
Cover'd with thick embattled squadrons might,
Chariots, and flaming mma, and fiery steeds‚
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view.

War he perceiv'd, war in procinct3 and found .
Already known, what he for news had thought

To have reported: gladly then he mix'd

Among those friendly Powers, who him receiv’d
With joy and acclamations loud, thatone,

That of so many myriads fallu, yet one

Return'd, not lost. On to the sacred hill

They led him high applauded, and present

Before the seat 'supreme3 ‚from whence a voice,

From midst a golden cloud,' thus mild was heard:

«Servant of God‚ well done; well hast thou fought
The better fight, who single hast maintain’d
Against revolted multitudes the cause
Of truth, in word mightier thanthey in arms: '
And for the testimony' of truth hast borne

Universal reproaeh‚ far worse to hear

Than violence: for this was all thy care

To stand approv'd in sight of God‚ though worlds
