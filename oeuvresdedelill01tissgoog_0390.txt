aso PARADISE coss, r: v.

The supple lnce? Ye will not, if l trust
To know ye right3 or, ifye know yourselves
Natives and sons of heaven, possess'd before
By none3 and if not equal all, yet free,

’ Equally free3 ior orders and degrees

Jar not with liberty, but well consist.

Who can in reason 'then or right, assume ’

Monarchy over such as live by right ¹

His equals,.il in power and splendour less,

ln freedom equal? or can introduce

Law and edict on ns, who without law

Err noth much less for this to be our lord,
And look for adoration, to the' ahuse

Of those imperial titles, which assert

Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve. s

«Thus far his hold discourse without controul
Had audience; when among the seraphim
Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal ador’d
The deity, and divine commands obey'd,

Stood up, and in a flante of zeal severe
The current of his fury thus oppos’d:

- (ι Ο argument blasphemous, salse and proud!
Words which no ear ever to hear in heaven
Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate,
ln place thysclf so high above thy peers.

Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn

The just decree of God, pronounc'd and sworn,
That to his only son hy right endued

Witgh regal sceptro, every soul in heaven
