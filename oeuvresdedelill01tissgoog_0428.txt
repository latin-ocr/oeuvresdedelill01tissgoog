tte Pauaolsu LOST, B. Vl.

Vanquish'd adramelech, and Asmadai,
Two potent thrones, that to be less than Gods
. Disdain’d, hut meaner thoughts learn'd in their ssight,
Mangled with ghastly wounds through plote and mail.
Nor stood unmindful abdiel to annoy
The atheisteren'‚ but with redoubled blow
Ariel and Arioch, and the violence
0f Ramiel‚ scorch’d and blasted, overthrow.

l might relate of thousauds, and their names
Eternize here on earth; but those elect
hugels, contented with their fame in heaven,
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort,
ln might though wondrous and in acts of war,
Nor of renowu less eager, yet by doom
Cancell'd from heaven aud sacred memory,
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
For strength from truth divided, and from just,

lllaudable, nought merits but dispraise

Veia-glorious‚ end through infamy seelrs fame:
Therefore, eternal silence be their doom.

And ignominy3 yet to glory’ aspires ·

And now, their mighticst quell'd‚ the battle swerv’d,
With many an inroad gor’d3 deformed rout
Enter'd‚ and foul disorder; all the ground
With shiver'd armour strown, audon aheap
Chariot and charioteer lay overturn’d‚
And fiery·foaming steeds3 what stood, recoil'd
O'er·wearied, through the faint Sotanic host
