re remorso eosr, e. 1.

All her original hriglttness3 nor appeer'd

⁸ less then Archangel ruin'd‚ end the’ excess

0f glory' ohscur’d ε es when the eun, new risen,
looks through the horizontal misty eir

Shom of his heams ε or from behind the moon,
ln dim eclipse‚ disastrous twilight sheds

On hals the nations, and with fear ol change
Perplexes monarche. Darken'd so, yet ehone
Above them all the Archangel ι hut his faoe
'Deep seet's of thunder had intrenoh’d3 and cere
Sat on his laded cheek‚ but under hrows

Of dauntless courage, end considerate pride
Waiting revenge3 cruel his eye, but cast

Signs ol remorso and passion, to behold

The follows of his crime, the followers rather,
(Far other once heheld in bliss) condemn'd
For ever now to have their lot in pain :
Millions ol spirits for his fault amere’d

Ol Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung
For his revolt, yet faithful how they stood,

Their glory wither’d.

As when Heaven's fire
Heth scath’d the forest oalts, or mountain pines,
