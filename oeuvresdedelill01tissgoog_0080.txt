to PARADISE LOST‚ B. 1.

· Belial came last, than whom a spirit more lewd
Tell not from Hoeven, or more gross to love
Vico for itself : to him no temple stood

Or altar smok’d; yet who more ost than he

ln temples and at altars, when the priest

Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filt’d

With lust and violence the house of God?

ln courts and polaees he also migne,

And in luxurious citios, where the-noise

of riot' ascende above their loftiest towers,

¹And injury and outrage3 and when night

Darkens the streete, then wander forth the sons
0f Belial, flown with insolesce and wine. ⁸
Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night.

ln Gibeah, when the hospitahle door

Expos'd a metron, to avoid worse rape.

These were the prime in order and in might:
The rest were long to tell, though far renown’d, ’
The' Ionian Gods, of Javan's issue, held
Gods, yet confess’d later than Heaven and Earth,
Their boasted petente : Titan, Hoeven’s first-born,
With his enormous brood, end birthright seiz'd
By younger Saturn3 hesrom mightier ¹Jove,

· His own and Rhea's son, like measure found3

So Jove usurping reign’d: these first in Crete
