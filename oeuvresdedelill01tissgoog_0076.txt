66 ΡᾹΒΑΒΙΞΕ LOST, B. l.
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs ε

ln Sion also not unsung, where stood

Her temple of the' offensive mountain, built

By that uxorious king, whose heart, though large,
negua’a‘ay aa idoneam, fen

To idols foul.

Thammuz came next behind,
Whose annuat wound in Lehanon allur'd
The Syrien damsels to lament his fate

’ 1η amorous ditties all a summer’s day3

While smooth Adonis from his native rock

Rau purple to the sea, suppos'd with blood

of Thammuz yearly wounded ε the love-tale

· Infected Sion's daughters with like heat ;

Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch
Ezekiel saw, when, hythe vision led,
His eye survey’d the dark idolatries

Of alienated Judah. Next came one
Who mourn'd in nemost, when the captive ark

Maim'd his brute image, head and hands lopt off
ln his own temple, on the grunsel-edge‚
Where he fell flat, and sham’d his worshippers :
Dagon his name, sea-monster, upward man
And downward fish: yet had his temple high
Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through-the coast

of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,

And Accaron and Gaza’s frantia-bonnas.
