Each in their several active spheres assign'd,

Till body up to‘spirit work, in bounds

Proportion’d to each kind. So from the root

Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves
More aery, last the bright consummate ssower ι

Spirits odourous breathes : flovers and their fruit,

Man's nourishment, hy gradual scale suhlim'd

To vital spirits aspire, to animal,

To intellectuah give both life and sense,
Fancy and understanding3 whence the soul
Reason receiveS, and 'reason is her being,
Discursive or intuitive3 discourse

ls oftest poure, the latter most is ours‚
Differing but in degree, os kind the same.
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good
lf I refuse not, but convert, as you,

To proper substance. Time may come, when rnen
With angels may participate, and find

No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;

And from these corporal nutrimenta perhaps
Your bodies may at last'turn all to spirit,
Improv’d by tract citime, and, wing'd‚ ascend
Ethereal‚ as we3 or may, at choica,

Here or in heavenly paradise dwell;

Unalterably firm his love entire, Ἴ

Whose progeny you are. Meanwhile enjoy
Your fill what happiness this happy state

Can comprehend‚ incapahlc os more. υ
