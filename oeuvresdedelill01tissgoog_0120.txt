> Thus trample'd, thus expell’d to suffer here
Chains and these torments? better these than worse,
By my advice, since late inevitahle
Subdues us, and omnipolent decrec‚
The victor’s will. To suffer, as to do,
Our strength is equal, nor the law unjust
That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,
ll we were wisc against so great a loe
Contending, and so doubtfull what might fall.
l laugh, when those who at the spear are bold
And venturous, it that fail them, shrink and lear ’ ·
What yet they know must follow, to endure
Exile, or ignominy‚ or honds, or pain,
The sentence of their conqueror: this is now
Our doom; which it we can sustain and bear,
α Our supreme foe in time may much remit
His anger; and perhaps, thus far remov’d,
Not mind us not offending, sotislied
With what is punish'd3 whence these raging fires
will, slaclten, if his hreath stir not their flames.

Our purer essence then will overcome

Their noxious vapour, or, inur’d, not seel;

Or chang’d at length, and to the place conform’d
ln temper and in nature, will receive

Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain3

This horror will grow mild, this darkness light;
Besides what hope the never-ending llight

Of future days may bring, what chance, what change

Worth waiting ; since our present lot appears
