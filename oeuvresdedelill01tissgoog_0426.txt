By angels many' and strong, who interpos’d
Defence, while others bore him on their shields
Back to his ohariot, where it stood retir’d
From off the files of war : there they him laid
Gnashing for anguish‚ and despite, and shame,
To find himself not matohless‚ and his pride
llumhled hy such rehuhe‚ so far heneath
His confidence to equal God in power. '
Yet soon he heal’d3 for spirits that live throughout
Vital in every part, not as frail man s
In entrails, heart or head, liver or reios,
Cannot hut hy annihilating die;
Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
Receive, no more thannan the fluid air:
All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,
All intellect, all sense; and, as they please,
They limb themselves, and colour, shape‚ or size
Assume, as likes them hest, condense or rare.
Meanwhile in other parts like deeds deserv'd
Ι Memorial‚ where the might of Gabriel fought,
And with fierce ensigns pierc'd the deep army
· Of Molooh, furious king, who him defied,
And at his chamot-wheels to drag him bound
¹ Threaten’d, nor from the Holy-One of heaven
Refrain'd his tongue blasphemous; hut anon
Down cloven to the wraist, with shatter'd anns

And uncouth pain lled bellowing. On each wing

Though huge, and in a rock of diamond arm’d,

 

Uriel, and Raphael‚ his vaunting foe,
