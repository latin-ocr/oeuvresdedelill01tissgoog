stt PthDlSE LOST, B. V.

Into the blissful field, through grores of myrrh,
hod flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm;
A wilderness of sweets3 for nature here
Wanton'd as in her prime, and play'd at will
Her virgin fancies, pouring forth more sweet,
Wihi above rule or art, enormous bliss.

Him through the spiey forest onward come
Adam discern'd, as in the door he sat
Of his cool bower, while now the mounted sun
Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm
Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than hdam needs:
And Eve within, due at her hour prepar’d
For dinner savoury fruits, of toste to please .

True appetite, and not disrelish thirst
Oinectarous draughts between, from milky stream,

Berry or grape ε ιο whom thus Adam eall'd:
« Haste hither, Ere, and worth thy sight behold

Eastward among those trees, what glorious shape
Comes this way moving3 seems another mom
Ris'n on mid-noon; some great behest from heaven
To us perhaps he brings, and wilt rouchsafe

This day to be our guest. But go with speed,
And, what thy stores contain, bring forth; aud pour
Abundanoe, tit to honour and receive

Our heavenly stranger: well may we afford

Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow
From large bestow’d, where nature multiplies
Her fertile growth3 and by disburdening grows
More sruitful, which instructs us not to spare. n
