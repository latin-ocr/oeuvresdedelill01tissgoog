Kiss'd, as the grecious signs of sweet remorso
And pious owe, thet fear'd to have offended.

. So all was clear’d, and to the field they haste.

But first, from under shady arboreus roof
Soon as they sorth were come to open sight
Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce uprisen,
With wbeels yet bovering o'er the ocean-brim,
Shot parallel to the' earth his dewy ray,
Discovering in wide landskip ell the east
Of paradise end Eden's happy plains,
Lowly they bow'd adoring, end began
Their orienes, each morning duly paid
ln various style; sor neither yarious style

Nor holy raptore¹ wanted they to preise Ι

Their Maker, in fit streins pronounc'd or simg
Unmediteted3 euch prompt eloquence
Flow'd from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,
More tuneahle than needed lot or herp ·
To edd more eweetness3 end they thus begenz

α These ere thy glorious works, parent of good,
hlmighty! Thine this universal home,
Thus wondrous fair ; thysels how wondrous them
Unspeekeble, who sit’st above these heavens
To us invisible, or dimly seen

, ln these thy lowest works3 yet these declere ·

Thy goodness beyond thought, end power· divine.
