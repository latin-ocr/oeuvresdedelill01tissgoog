146 PARADISE LOST, Bw. ΙΙ.

Voluminous and vast 3 a serpent arm'd

With mortal sting: about her middle round

Α cry of Heli-hounds never'ceasing bark’d'

With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung
Ahideous peal; yet, when they list, would ereep,
If ought disturb’d their noise, into her womb,

and kennel there3 yet there still hark’d and howl’d, .

Within unseen. Far less ahhorr'd than these
Vex’d Scylla, bathing iu the sea that parta

Ἰ Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore:

Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when call'd

In secret, riding through the air she eomes, Ι
Lur'd with the amellos infant blood, to danae
With Lapland witohes, while the labouring moon
Eolipses at their charma-

»The other ahape,
1f ahape it might be oall’d‚ that shape had none

Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;
Or substance might be call’d, that shadow seem’d, ’
For each seem’d either3 black it stood as Night,
Fierce as ten Furios, terrible as Hell‚

And shooka dreadful dart3 what seem'd his head
The likeness of a kingly crown had on.

Satan was now at hand, and from hia seat

The monster, moving onward, came as fast

With horrid strides3 Hell trembled aa he strode.
The' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, Ἴ
Admir'd, not sear’d; God and his Son exeept,
