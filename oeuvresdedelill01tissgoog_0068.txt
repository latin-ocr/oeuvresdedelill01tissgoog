They heard, end were abash'd, and up they sprung

Upon the wing, ns when men wont to watch

On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight

ln which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
Yet to their general's voice they soon ohey’d
innumerable. ts when the potent rod

Ol Amram's sou, in Egypt's evil day,
‘Wav’d round the coast, up mll’d opitchy cloud
Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,

That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung
Like night, and darken’d all the land of Nile :
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell,
'Twixt upper, esther, and surrounding fires;
Till, as asignal giren, thc’ up·lifted spear

0f their great Sultan waning to direct

Their course, in ewen balance down they light
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain;

Α multitude, like which the populous North
Ponr'd never from her irozcn loius, to pass
Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons
Came like a delnge on the south, and spread
Beneath Gibraltar to the Lybian sands.

Ἴ Forthwith from every sduadron and each band

The heads and leaders thither haste, where stood
Their great commendem godlike shepes und forms
Excelling human: princely Dignities3
