Now less thau smallest dwarfs, lunsrrow roone
Throug nuntberless, like that pygmean cuce⁴
Beyond the Indian mount3 or luery elves,
Whose midnight revelo, hy c forest-side

Or fountain, some belated pensant sees,

Or dreams he sees, while over-head the moon
Sits arbitrem, and nearer to the earth
Wheelsher pale course3 they, on thelr mirth and dauco ἵ
Intent, with jocund music charm his ear3

At once with joy and fsar his hesrt rebouuds.
Thus incorporeul spin'ts to smallestforms
Reduc'd their shepes immense, and were at large).
Though without number still, amidst the halt
Os that infernal court. But lar within,

And in their own dimenslous, like themselves,
The great seraphic lords and cherubim

ln close recess and secret conclave sat3

Α thousand demi-gods on goldon scats,

Frequent und full. ¹Alter short silence theu,

hnd summons read, the great consult began.
