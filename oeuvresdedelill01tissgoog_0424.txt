Of such commotion3 such as (to set forth

Great things hy small )if neture's eoneord broke,
Among the constellations war were sprung} ⁶

Nor solid might resist that edge, it met
The sword ef satan with steen seme ιο smioe
Descending‚ end in half cut sheer3 nor smid,
But with swift wheei reverse deep entering, shar'd
All his right side : then Satan first knew pain,
And writh’d him to and fro convolv'd3 so sore
The griding swerd with discontinuous wound
Pass’d through him: but the' etheredi substance cios’d
Not long dirisihle3 and from the gash
Α stream ufneetarous hmnour issuing ssow’d
Sanguine, sueh asnehestiel spirits may bieed,
hnd all his ermoursteimd erewhile so bright.
Forthwith on all sides to his nid wes run
