231 PARADISE Los'r, B. ΙΙΙ.

Eech had his place appointed, each his course3

The rest in circuit wells this universe.

Look downward on that globe, whose hither side
With light from hence, though but reflected‚ shines;
Thet piace is earth, the seat of Mam that light

His day, which else, as the' other hemisphere,

Night would invade3 but there the neighbouring Moon

¹ (So cell that opposite sair ster) her aid
Timely interposes‚ and her monthly round
Still ending, still renewiug, through mid Hoeven,
With borrow'd light her eountentnce triform
Hence fills and empties to enlighten the* Enrth,
Audin her pale dominion cheeks the night.

That spot, to which I'point, is Paradise,
Adam's abode3 those lofiy shades, his hower.

Thy way thou canst not miss3 me mine requires. υ
Thus said, heturn’d3 and Satan, bowinglow, ,

As to superior Spirits is went in Hoeven,

Where honour due and reverence none neglecte,

Took leave, and toward the coast oi earth hemath,

Down from the' ecliptic, sped with hop'd success,

Throws his steep ssight in many en aery whee13

Nor eteid, till on Niphates’ top he lights.
