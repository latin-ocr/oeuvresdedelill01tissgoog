Him follow’d Rimmon, whose delightful seat
Was fair-Damascus, on the fertile banks
0f Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
He also' against thohouse of God was bold 1
Α leper once he lost, and gain'd a king3
Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew
God's altar to disparage and displace,
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
His odious offerings, and adore the Gods

Whom he had vanquish’d. After these appear’d

Α crew‚ who,· under names of old renown,

Ι Osiris, Isis, OruS, and their train,

With monstruotrs shapes and sorceries abus'd
Fanotic Egypt and her priests, to seek

Their wandering gods disguis'd in brutish forms
Rather than human. Nor did lsrael ’scapo

. The' infectior, when their borrow'd gold compos’d

The calf in Oreb, and the rebel king

Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox3
Jehovah, who in ono night, when he pass'd

From Egypt marching‚ equall’d with one stroke

Both her first-born, and all her hleating gods.
