212 PARthSE LOST, B. 111.

Dark, waste, aud wttd, under the frown of Night
Starless expos'd, and ever-threatening storms
Of Chaos blustering round, inclemens sky 3
Save on that side which from the wall of heaven,
Though distant far, some small reflection gains
Osglimmering air, less vex’d with tempest loud :
Here walk’d the Fiend at large in spurious field.
hs when a vulture on Imaus bred,

Whose snowy ridge the roring Tartar bounds„
Dislodging frome region searoe os prey,

To gorga the ssesh of larnbs or yeanling kids,

On hills where ssocks are fed, flies toward the springs ’
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian strearns3

But in his away lights on the barren plains,

Of Sericum, where Chineses drive

With sails and wind their cany waggons light:
Su, on this wiudy sea of land, the Fiend
Walk'd up and down alone, beut on his preyr
Alone, for other creature in thia place,

Living or lifeless, to be found was none.

None yet3 but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like aeriahvapours ssew
Of all things transitory' and vain, when sin
With vanitg had fiu'd the works of ment ,
Both all things vain, and all who in rain things
