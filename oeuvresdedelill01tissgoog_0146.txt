135 Ponsolsss LOST, B. 11.

Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms
From either end of Hoeven the welkin burno.
Others, with vast Typhoean rege more fell,
Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air
ln whirlwind3 Heli scercc holds the wild uproar3
As when Alcides, from Oechalia crown'd
With conquest, felt the' envenom'd robe, and toro
Through pain, up by the roots Thessalian pines,
And Lichas from the top oi Oeta threw
lnto the’ Euboic sea.

Others more mild,
Retreated in a silent valley, sing
With notes angelioal to many a harp Ι

„ neo 'own heroic seces and sapies fan

By doom of battle3 and complain that fate

Free virtue should enthrsl to force or chance.
Their song was partis13 but the harmony

( What could it less when Spirits immortal sing? )
Suspended Heli, and took widi ravishmcnt

The thronging audience.

ln discourse more sweet
(For eloquence the soul, song charms the sense, )
Others spart seton a hill retird’,
ln thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high
Of providence, foreknowledge‚ will, and fate,
Fix'd fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,
And found no cod, in wandering mazes lost.
Oi good end evil much they argued then,
