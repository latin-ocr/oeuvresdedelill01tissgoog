tto Panlntsn Losa, B. 111.

Uninterrupted joy, unrivall’d love,

ln blissful solitnde; hethan surwey'd

Hell and the gnlf between, and Satan there
Coasting the wall 'of Heawen on this side Night
ln the dun air sublime, and ready now

To stoop with wearied wings and willing feet,
On the bare outside of this world, that seem'd
Firm land irnhosom'd, without firmament,
Uncertain which, in ocean or in tir.

Him God beholding from his prospect high,
ererein past, present, future, he beholds,
Thus to his only Son soreseeing spake ε

't Only hegotten Son, seest thou what rago
Transports our Adversary? whom no bonnds
Preserih’d, no bars of hell, nor all the chains
Heap’d on him there, nor yet the main nbyss
Wide interrupt, ean hold3 so bent he seems
On desperate revenge, that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head. And now,
Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way
⁸ Not far off heaven, in the precincts of light,
Directly towards the new-created world,

And Man there plac'd, with purpose to assay
lf him hy force he ean desti-oy, or, worse,

By some false guile pervert; and shall perverti
For Man will heerksn to hit gloting lies,

And easily transgress the sole command,
