Mysclf‚ and all the' angelic host, that stand

ln sight of God‚ enthron'd, our happy stato

Hold,¹ as you yourS‚ while our obediencc holds3

On other surely none: lreely we serve,

Because we frcely love, as in our will

To love or not; in this we stand or fall ι

And some are fall’n, to disobedicnce lall'n,

And so from heaven to decpest hell; 0 fall

From whathigh state of blico, into what woe! s
To whom our great progenitor: «Thy words

Attentive, and with more delighted ear,

Divine instructor, l have heard, than when

Cherubic songs by night from neighbouring bills

hercl music send3 nor knewl not

To be both will and deedcrcated free3

Yet that we never shall lorget to love

Our Maker, and obey him whose command

Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts

Assur’d me' and still assure: though what thou tell’st
. llath pass’d in bearem some doubt within me move,
But more desire to hear, if thou consent,

The full relation, which must needs be strange,
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard3

And we have yet large day, lor scarce the sun
Hatb finish’d hall bis journey, and scarce begins

His other hallin the great zone of heaven. a
Thus Adam made request3 and Raphael‚
Alter short pause assenting, thus began.
