322 PARAnlsE LosT, B. v.

Lightly dispers'd‚ and the shrill mutin-song
of birds on every bough.

So much the more
His wonder was, to find unwaken'd Eve
With tresses discompos'd, and glowing cheek,
As thmugh unquiet rest: he, on his side
Leaning half rais'd with looks of cordial love
Hung over her enamour'd, and behold
Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep‚
Shot forth peculiar grace& then with voice
Mild, as when Zephyrus or Flora breathes,

Her hand soft touching, whispered thus==

α Awake,
My fairest‚ my epous’d, my latest found,
Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delightl
Awake: the morning shines‚ ¹and the fresh fie'ld
Calls us3 we lose the prime, to mark how spring
Our tender planus, howwblows the citrea-grove,
What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,
How nature paints her colours, how the hee

Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet. »ι

Such whispering wak'ff her, but with ammiod eye ¹
