396 PthDISE LOST, B. VI.

Heroic ardour to adventurous deeds

Under their godlike leaders, in the cause

Of God and his Messiah. On they move
Indissolubly firm, nor obvious hill,

Nor streitening vele, nor wood, nor stream, divides
Their perfectrenks3 for high above the ground
Their march was, end the passive air upbore

Their -uimble treed: as when the total kind

of birds, in orderly array on wing,

Cerne summon’d over Eden to reoeive,

Their names of thee; so over many a tract

Of heeven they mareh'd, end many a province wide,
’ Tenfold the length of this terrene.

Atdest,

Fer in the' horizon to the north eppeer'd

From skirt to skirt afiery region, stretch'd

ln batteilous espect, and neerer view

Bristled with upright beems innumerable

Ofrigid speers, end helmets throng'd, end shields ’
Various, with boestfnl argument portrey’d,

The banded Powers of Setun hasting on

With furious expedition3 for they ween'd

That sels-same day, by fight, or by surprise,

To win the mount of God, and on his throne ’
To set the envier os his stete, the proud

Aspirer3 but their thoughts prov’d fond end vein
ln the mid wey ε though strange to us it seem'd
ht first,lthet Angel should with Angel wer,
