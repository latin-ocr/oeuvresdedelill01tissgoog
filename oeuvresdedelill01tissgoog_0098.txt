hnd level pavement ε for the archad roof
Pandunt hy suhtle magio many a row

Of starry lamps and blazing crassata, fed
With naphtha and asphaltus, yialded light
As from a sky. The hasty multitude Ι

. And some the architect3 his hand was known
ln Haaven by many a towar'd structure high,
W here scepter’d angals held their residence,
And sat as princes3 wham the supreme King,
Rralted to such power, and gave to rule,
Each in his hierarchy, the orders bright.
Nor was his name unheard, or unador’d
In ancient Graece3 and in Ausonian land
Men'call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell
From Heaven, they fablad, thrown by angry Jove
Shear o'er the crystal battlements: from morn
To noon basah, from noon to dewy eve, Ι
Α surhmer's day, and with the setting sun χ
Dropt from the zanith likeafalling star, ἵ
On Lemnos the' AEgean isle: thus they relate,
Erring3 for he with this rebellious rout
· Fell long before3 nor ought avail’d him now
To' have built in Heaven high towers3 nor did he' scapo
By all his anginas, hut was headlongseat

¹ With his iudustrious crew, to build in nell.
