On the solt downy bank damask’d with flowers.
The savoury pulp they chew, and in lhe rind,
Still as they thirsted‚ scoop the brimming stream ;
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles ’
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance‚ as heseems .
Fair eouple, link’d in happy nuptial league,

, Alone as they. About thern frisking play'd

All beasts of the’ earth, since wild‚ and of all ehase
In wood or wilderness‚ forest or den:

Sporting the lion ramp'd, andin his paw

Dandled the kid; hears, tigers, euneos, pards,
Gamboll'd before them3 the' unwieldy elephant,

To make them mirth, used ell his mighn end wreath’d

llis lithe probosois3 close the serpent sly,
lnsinuating, wore with Gordian twine

llis braided train, and ol his fatal guile

Gave proof unheeded3 others on the grass
Coueh'd, and now fill’d with passure gazing sat,
Or bedward ruminating; for the sun,

Declin’d‚ was hasting now with prone career
To the ocean isles, and in the’ ascending scale
Of heaven, the stars that usher evening rose=
When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood,
Scaree thus at length fail’d speech recover'd sad‚
