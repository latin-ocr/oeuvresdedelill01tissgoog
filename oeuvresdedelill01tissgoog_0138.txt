ias Piniorsncosr,n.11.

Our prison strong3 this hugc convex oi fire,
Outrageous to devour, immutes us round
Ninefold3 and gates oi hurning adamant,
Barr’d over us, prohibit all egress.

These pass’d, if any pass, the void proiound
of unessential¹ Night receives him next

W ide gaping, and with utter loss oi being
Threatens him, plung'd in that abortire guli.
lf thence he'scape into whatever world,

Or unknown region, what remains him less
Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape?
But I should ill become this throne, Ο Peers‚
And this imperial sorranty, adorn'd

With splendour, arm'd with power, if ought propos'd
And judged of public moment, in the shape
Of difficulty, or danger, could deter

Me from attempting. .

Wherefore dol assume
These royalties, and not refuse to reign,
Reiusing to accept as great a share
Of hazard as of honour, due alike
To him who reigns, and so much to him due

0f hazard more, as he above the rest
’ High honour'd sits?

Go, therefore, mighty Powers,
