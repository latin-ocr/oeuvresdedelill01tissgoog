tt ouoe they hear thet voice, their liveliest pledge

of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft

ln worst extremes, endon the periious edge

0f battle when it reg'd, in all asseults

Their surest signal, they will soon resume

New courege and revive; though now they lie

Groveling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,

As we erewhile, astounded end amez'd;

No wonder, fall’n suc-h a peruicious heighth. »2
He searoe hed eeas'd, when the superior Fiend

Was moving toward the shore: his ponderous thield,

Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,

Behind him cest3 the broad circumferenee

Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose orh

Through optio glass the Tuscan artist views

At evening from the top oi Fesole,

Or in Valdamo, to descry new lando,

Rivers, or mountains in her spotty globe.

His spear, to equei which the tellest pine

Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast

Of some great ammiral, were but 3 wand,

He walk'd with, to support uneas'y steps

Over the buruing merle, not like those steps

On Heeren’s azure, aud the torrid clime

‘ Smote ori him sore besides, vaulted with fire:

Nathless he so endur'd‚ till on the berch

Of thet iussemodsea he stood, and eaii’d

His legions, angel-forms, who lay intrano¹d‚
Thiek as autumna! leaves that strow the brooks
