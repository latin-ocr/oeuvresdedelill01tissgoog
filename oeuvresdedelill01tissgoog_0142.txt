Or close ambition‚ varnish’d o'er with zeal.

Thus they their doubtful consultatione dark
Ended‚ rejoicing in their matchless Chief :
As when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds
Aaccnding, while the north-wind sleeps, o'erspread

Heaven’s checrful face, the louring clement

Scowls o'cr the darken’d landskip snow, or shower3

If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet
Extend his eveningheam, the fields revive‚
The birds their notes renew, and blcating herds
Attest 'their joy, that hill and valley rings.

Ο shame to men! Devil with deril damn'd
Firm concord holds, men only disagree

Of creaturos rational, though under hope

of heavenly grace t and, ( God proclaiming peace, )

Yet live in hatred, emnity, and strise,

Among themselves, and levy cruci wars,

Wasting the earth, each other to destroy:

hs if ( which might induce us to accord)

Man had not hellish foes enow besides,

That, day and night, for his destruction wait.
The Stygian council thus dissolv'd; a‘nd forth

In ordercamc the grand infernal peers3

Midst came their mighty paramount‚ and secm’d

Alone the antagonist of Heavcn, nor less

Thau Hell’s dread emperor, with pomp supreme,

And god-like imitated state a him round

Α glohe of fiery Seraphim enclos'd,

With bright imblazonry, and horrent arms.
