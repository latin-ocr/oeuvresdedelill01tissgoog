Forthwith his former state and being forgcts,

Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
Beyond this flood a frozen continent

Lies dark and wild, beat trith perpetual storms

Of whirlwindand dire hail, which on firm land

Thaws not, but gethers hcap, and ruin seems

Of ancient pile3 or else deep snow and icc,

A gulf profound, as thatScrhonian hog

Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,

Where armies whole have sunk ε the parching air

Burns frore, and eold performs the effect offire,

Thither by harpy·footed furies hal'd,

At certain revolutions, all the darnn’d

Are hrought3 and feel by turns the bitter change

Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fiercc,
From beds of raging fire, to starve in ice

Their soft etherea} warmth, and there to pine
lmmovable, infix'd, and frozen round,

Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.
They serry over this Lethean sound

Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,

And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach

The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose
ln sweet forgetfuluess all pain and noe,

All in one moment, and so near the brink;

Ι But Fate withstands, and to oppose the' attempt,

Medusa with Gorgonian terror guarda
The ford, and of itself the water ssies
, All taste of living wight, as once it ssed
