Thus Beelzebub

, Pleaded his devilish counsel, first devis'd

By Satan, a'nd in part propos'd: for whence,
But from the author os all ill, could spring
So deep ennelino, to confound theraeo ι
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hcll
To mingle and involve, done all to spite
The great Creator? But their spite still serves
His glory to augment. The bold design
Pleas’d highly those infernal states, and joy
sparnea in nl aaa eyes, wita fun assent
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.

a Well have ye jndg’d, well ended long debete,
V Synod os Gods‚ and, like to what ye are,
Great things resolv'd, which, from the lowest deep,
Will once more list us up, in spite of fate, Ι
Nearer our ancient seat3 perhaps in view
of those brightconfines, whence,with neighbouringarms,
An opportune excursion, we may chance
lle-enter lleaven: or else in some mild zone
Dwell, not unvisited ol lleaven's fair light,
Secure3 and at the brightening orient boam s
Purge off this gloom: the soll deliciousair,
To heal the scar of these corrosive lires,
Shall breathe her balm. But first whom shall we send
ln search of this new world? whom shall we find

Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering leet
The dark unbottom'd infinite abyss,
