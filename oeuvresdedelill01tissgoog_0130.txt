120 PhRADlSE LOST, B. ll.

Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part

By our revolt3 but over llell extend

llis empire, and with iron scepter rule

Us here, as with his goldcn those in Heaven.
What sit we then projecting peace and war?
War hath determin'd us, and soil'd with loss
lrreparable: temus of peace yet none

vouchsard or songht3 fort what peace willbegiveu
To us enslav'd, but custody severe,

aad stripes, and arbitrary punishment

lullictedl' and what peace can we return,

But to our power hostility and hate,

’ ’ Untam'd reluctance, and revenge, though slew,

Yet ever plotting⁷ how the conqueror least

May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice

ln doing what we most in suffering feel?

Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need

With dangerous expedition to invade

Heaven, whose high walls sear no assault or siege,
Or ambush from the deep. What il we lind
Some easier enterprise? There is a place,

( lt ancient and prophetic fame in Hoeven

Err not, ) another world, the happy seat

Ol some new raoe call'd Man, about this time
To be created like to us, though less

ln power and excellence, but favour’d more

Os him who rnles above, so was his will
Pronounc'd among the Gods, and hy an oath,
Tlrat shoolt lleaven’s wholecircumlerenoe, confirm'd.
