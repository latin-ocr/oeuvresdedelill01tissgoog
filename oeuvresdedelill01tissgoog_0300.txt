With charrn of earliest birds3 pleasant the sun,
When first on this delightful land he spreads

His orient beatus, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,

After soit showers3 and sweet the coming on

Glistering with dew3 nor fragrance after showers3

Nor grateful evening mild3 nor silent night,

With this her solemn hird, nor walls by moon, ·

Or glittering stur-light, without these is m.
