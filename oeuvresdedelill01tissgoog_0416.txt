Hosanna to tlte Htonesa!

Not stood at gaze
The adverse legions, not· less hideous join'd
The horrid shook. Nor storming fury rose,
And elamour such as heard in heaven till now
Was never :arms on armour olashing bray’d
Horrible diseord, and the madding wheels
Os brazen chariots rag’d3 dire was the noise
0f conflict3 over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery darts in flaming vollies ssew,
And flying vaulted either host with fite.
So under stery eope together rush'd

Both battles main, with ruinous assault

And inextinguishahle rage. tlt heaven
Resounded3 and had earth been then, alt earth

ttad to her centre shook. What wonder? when
Millions of fierce eneounteting angele fought

On either side, the least of whom could wield
These elements‚ and arm him with the soree

Of all their regions: how much more of power
Army’ against army numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion wmring, and disturb,
Though not destroy, their happy native seat3
Had not the' Eternal KingAOmnipotenh

From his strong hold of heaven, high over-rul'd
