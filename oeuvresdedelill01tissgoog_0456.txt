tte PARADISE LOST, B. Vl.

And wings were set with eyes3 with eyes the wheels
Of beryl‚ and careering fires between;

Over their heads a crystal firmament,

Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure
Amber, and colours of the showery arch.
= He, in celestia! panoply all arm'd

Of radiant Urim‚ work divinely wrought,
Ascended3 at his right hand Victory

Sat engle-wing’d3 beside him hung hia bow
And quiver, with three-bolted thunder stor'd3
And from about him heroe effusion roll’d

Of smoke, and bickering fleme and sparklcs dire.
Attended with ten thousand thousand saints,
He onward came; far off his coming shone3
And twenty thousand (1 their number heard)
Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen:
He on the wings of cherub rode sublime

On the crystallino sky, in sapphire thron'd,
illustrious far and wide3 but by his own
Firstkseen3 them unexpected joy surpris'd,
When the great ensign ofMessiah blaz'd

Aloft by angels borne, his sign in heaven3
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduc’d

His army, circumfus’d on either wing,
Under their head imbodied all in one.

Before him Power Divino his way prepar’d3
At his command the' uprooted hills retir'd
