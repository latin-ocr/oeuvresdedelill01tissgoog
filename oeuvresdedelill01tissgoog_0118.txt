108 PthDlSE Los'r, B. ll.

The deep to shelter us? this Heli then seem’d
Arefuge from those wounds; or when we lay
Cheh‘d on the burning lake? that sure was worse.
What if the hreath‚ that kindled those grim hres,
hwak'd‚ should blow them into seven-sold roge
And plunge ui in tho flames? or, from above,
Should intermitted vengeanoe arm again

His red right hand to plogue us? What if alt
Her stores were open'd, and thie iit-imment

¹Of Hell should spout her catarecte of fleo,
Impendent horrnrs, threatening hideous fall

One day upon our heads3 while we perhaps,
Designing or exhorting glorious war,

Caught in a fiory tempest shall be hurl'd

anh on his rock transfix’d, the sport and proy
Os wraoking whirlwinds; or for ever sunk
Under yon boiling ocean, wmpt in chaios3 ¹
There to oonvorse with evoriasting groanS,
Unrespited‚ unpitied‚ unrepriev’d, ’

hges of hopeless end? Thio would be worse.

« War therefore, open or conceal’d, aliie

My voice dissuades3 for what can force or guile

With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye

Views all things at one view? He ,from Heaven's heighth
hll these our motione vain sees, andderidos; 1
Not more almighty to restet our might

Than wiso to frustrate all our plote ond wileo.

Sholl we then live thus 'vile‘ tho'raoo' of Hoeven,
