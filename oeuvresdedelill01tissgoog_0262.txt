252 Plttlntsn LOST, B. tv. ³
One gete'there only was, and thet loolt’d East

On the’ other side: which when the' arch-selon saw, l

Due entrance he disdoin'd3 end, in contempt,
nmwmmwmmwmffl
Of hill or highest wall, and sheer within

nghts on his feet. As when s prowling woll,
Whom hunger drives to seelt new haunt for prey,
Watching where shepherds pen their floelts at eve
ln hurdled cotes ninid the field secure,

Leaps o'er the fenee with ease into the lold ε

0r ase thies, bent to unhoard the eash

Ol some rich burgher, whose substantial doors,
Cross-barr'd and holted fast, seer no assault;

ln at the window elirnbs, or o'er the tiles :s
So clomb this first grand thies into God’s solt-13 ·

So since= into his ehurch lewd hirelings climb.

Thence up he ssew, end on the tree of lile,
¹ 'l'he middle tree end highest there that grew,
Sat like a conmorant3 yet not true life

Thereby regsin'd, but sat derising death

To them who liv’d3 nor on the virtue thought
omfflfflwmeffl

For prospect wltot well used hed been the pledge
Of immortality. So little knows

Any, but God alone, to velue right

The good before him, but perverts best things
'l'o worst ebuse, ot· to their meenest use.
