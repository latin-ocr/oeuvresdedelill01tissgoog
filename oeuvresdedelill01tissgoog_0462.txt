With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs Ι
of his fierce cbariot roll’d‚ as with the anund

of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.

He on his impious foes right onward drove,-
Gloomy as night3 under his httrning wheels

The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,

Among them he arrived3 in his right hand
Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent

All coura303 down their idle neapons dropt:
O’er shields,‘ and helim, and holmed heads he rodo
Of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate, ‚

Thrown on them as a shelter from' his ire.

Glar’d lightning, and shot fonth pernicious fire'
Among the' accurs’d, thatwither'd att their strength,
And of their wonted vigour leh the'm drain'd,
innatet, spiritns, afflictet, nnn. “

Yet half his strength he put not forth, hut check'd
His thunder in mid volley3 sor he meant
