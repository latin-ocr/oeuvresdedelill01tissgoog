THE ARGUMENT,

Raphael continues to relate how Michncl and Gabriel were sent
lorth to battle against Satan aud his augels. The first light
described: Satan aud his powers retire under night: he callsc
.·0uncit; invenis devilish engines, which, in the second day’s
light, put Michael and his angele to some disorder; hut they at
length, pulling up mountains, overwhelmed both the force and
vuachines ol datan: yet, the tumult not so ending. God, on the.
third (lay, sends lilessiah his son, for whom he had reserved the
glory of that victory.. lle, in the power of his Father‚ coming
to the place, and causing all his legions ιο stand still uu either
side, with his chariot aud thuudev driving into the midst ol his
enemies, pursues thern, rvnshle ιο resim, towards the wall ol
heaven: which opening, they leap down with horror and con·
lusion into the place ol punishment prepared lor them in the
deep: Messiah returns with triumph to his Fathcr.

¹ All night the dreadless angel unpursued,

¹ Through Heaven’s wide champain held his way : till Moru.

Wak’d by the circling Hours, with rosy hand

Unbarr'd the gates of light. There is a cave

Within the mount ol God, fast by his throne,

Where Light and Darkness in perpetual round

Lodge anddislodgehy turns, which makes through heaven
Grateful vicissitude, like day aud night:

Light issnes forth, aud attho other door
