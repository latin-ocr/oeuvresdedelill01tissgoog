And now, divided into four main streame,

Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm

And country, whereof here needs no account3

But rather to tell'how, if art could tell,

How from that sapphire fount the crisped hroohs‚
Rolling on orient pearl and sande of gold,

With mazy error under pendant shades

Rau nectar, visiting each plant; and fed

Flowers worthy' of Paradise‚ which not nice art
ln beds and curious knots, but nature boon
Pour'd forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,
Bot where the morning sun first warmly smote
The open field, and where the unpierc'd shade
Imbrown’d the noontide bowers,
