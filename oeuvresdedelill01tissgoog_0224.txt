tlt· PARADISE LOST, Β. 111.

Built their fond hopes of glory' or lasting fame,
Or happiness in this or the' other liie; ·

All who have their reward on earth, the fruits
Of painlul superstition and blind zeal,

Nought seeking, but the praise of men, here lind
Fit retribution, empty as their deeds3

All the' unaccomplish’d works of Nature’s hand, ·
Abortive, monstrous‚ or unkindly mix’d,
Dissolv’d on earth, lleet hither, and in rain,

Till final dissolutior, wander here;

Not in the neighbouring moon, as some have dremn’d3
Those argent fields more likely habitants,
Translated saints, or middle Spirits hold

Betwixt the' angelical and human kind.

Hither of ill-join’d sons and daughters born

First from the ancient world those giants came

With-many a vain exploit, though then renown'dz.

The builders next ofBabel on the plain ,

Of sennaar, and still with vain design,

New Babels, had they wherewithal, would buitd:
Others carne single; he, who to be deern'd
hGod, leap'd fondly into AEtna flames,
Empedoclem and he, who, to enjoy

Plato's Elysium, leap'd into thesea,
Cleombrotus; and many more too long,
Embryos and idiots, eremites and friars

White, black, and gray, with all their trompery,
Here pilgrims roam, that stray’d so sar to seek

ln Golgotha him dead, who lives ianeaveni
