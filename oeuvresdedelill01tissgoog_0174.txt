161 Pananlsn LOST, B. 11.

Without dimension‚ where length-breodun and heighth
And time, and place are lost; where eldest Night

And Chaos, ancestors os Nature, hold

' Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise

01 endless wars, and by confusion stand.

For hot, eold, moist, and dry, four champions heroe,
Strive here for mestery‚ and to battle bring

Their enthryon atoms; they around the flag

01 eaohhis fection, in their several olens,

Light-arm’d or heavy, sha1·p,smooth‚ satist, or slhw,

Swarrn populous, un·n1nnber’d as the sends

Of Barca or Cyrene’s torrid soil,
Levied to side anth warring nands, and poise
Their lighter wings. To 'whom these most adlrere

¹ He rulesa moment ε Chaos umpire sits,

and by decision more embroils the frey,

By which he reigns: next him high-arbiter,

Chanoe governs all. Into this wild abyss,

, The womb of Nature„ and perhaps her ¹grave,
Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire,
But all these-in their pregnant causes mix'tl
confusae, aaa arista taus mussare-gn,

Unless t'he’ hhnig'hty Maker them ordain

His dark materials to create more worlds.
