What should they do? if on they rush’d, repulse
Repented, and inderent overthrow

Doubled, would render them yet more despis'd,
And to their locs a laughter3 for in view

Stood ranl’d of seraphim another row,

Ι ln posture to displode their second tire

Ol thunder: back defeated to return

They worse abhorr’d.

So they among themselves in pleasant vein

Stood scoffing, heighten'd in their thoughts beyond
All doubt of victory: Eternal Might

To match with their inventions they presum'd

So easy, and of his thunder made a suoru,

And all his host derided, while they stood

Awltile in trouble t¹ hut they stood not long3

Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
hgainst such hellish mischief fit to’ oppose.
Forthwith(behold the excellence, the power,
Which God hath in his mighty angels plac'd! )
Their arms away they threw, and to the hille

(For earth hath this variety from heaven

Of pleasure situate in hill and dale)

Light as the lightning-glimpse they ran, they flow3
From their foundations loosening to and fr0‚

They pluck'd the seated hills, with all their load,
Rocks, waters, woodS, and by the shaggy tops
Up·listing bore them in their hands; amaze,

Be. sure, and terror, seiz'd the rebel-host,

When coming towards them so dread they saw
