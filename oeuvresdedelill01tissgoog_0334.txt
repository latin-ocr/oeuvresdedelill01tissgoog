Close at mine ear one eall'd me sorth to walk
With gentle voiee; l thought it thine: it said,

The cool‚ the silent, save where silence yields
To the night-warbling bird, that now awalre
Tunes sweetest his love-labour'd song; now reigns
Full-orb'd the moon, and withmere pleasing light

Shadowy¹ sets off the face of things3 in vain,
lf none regard3 heaven wakes with all his eyeS‚

Whom to behold but thee, nature's desire ἳ-
ln whose sight all things joy, with ravishment

Attracted by thy beauty, still to gaze.

«Ι rose as at thy call, but found thee nott
To find theel directed then my walk;
And on, methought, alone 1 pass'd through ways
That brought me on a sudden to the tree
of interdicted knowledge: fair it seem'd,
Much fairer to my fancy than by day:
