402 PARADlSE LOST, B. Vl.

Of my revenge, first sought for, thou return'st
From flight, seditious angel! to receive

Thy merited reward, the first assay

Of this right hand provok'd, since first that tongue,
Inspir'd with contradiction, durst oppose

Α third part of the GodS, in synod met

Their deities to assert3 who, while they feel
Vigour divine within them, can allow
Omnipotence to none. But well thou com'st
Before thy follows, ambitious to wiu

From me some plume, that thy success may show
Destruction to the rest: this pause between,
(Unanswer'd lest thou boast) to let thee knoW,

Αι first l thought that liberty and heaven

To heavenly souls had been all one3 but now

I see that most through sloth had rather serve,
Minist'ring spirits, train'd up in feast and song!
Such hast thou arm’d, the minstrelsy of heaven,
Servility with freedom to contend, '

As both their deeds eompar’d this day shall prove. υ

To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied ε
ἀ Apostate! still thou err'st, nor end wilt find

Of erring, from the path of trutb remote:
Unjustly tbou deprav'st it with the name

Of servitude, to serve whom God ordainS,

Or nature a God and nature bid the *same
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels
