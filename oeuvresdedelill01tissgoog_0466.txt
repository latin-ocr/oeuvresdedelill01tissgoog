456 PARADISE LOST‚ Β. 'Vh

Sole vietor, from the’ expulsion of his foes,
Messiah his triumphal chariot turn’d3

To meet him all his saints, who silent stood .
Eye-witnesses of his almighty acts,

With jubilee advanc'd3 and, as they went,
Shaded with branching palm, each order bright,
Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,
Son, hen, ana tora, to nm dominon given· ’
Worthiest to reign. He, celebrated, rode
Triumphant through mid heaven, into the courts
And temple of his Mighty Father‚ thron'd

On high3 who into glory him receiv'd‚ Ι
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.

Thus, measuring things in heaven by things on earth,
At thy request, and that thou may’st beware

By what is past, to thee l have reveal'd

What might have else to human raoe been hid Ἰς
The discord which hesel, and war in heaven
Among the³ angelie powers, and the deep fall
Of those too high aspiring‚ who rebell'd

With Satan3 he who envies now thy state,-
Who now is plotting how he may seduco

Thee also from obedienoe‚ that, with him
