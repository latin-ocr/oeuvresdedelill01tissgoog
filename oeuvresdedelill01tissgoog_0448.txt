438 Ptunnlsu LOST, B. vt.

The bottom of the mountains upward turn’d3

Till on those oursed engines, triple-rou

They saw them whelm'd, and all their confidence

, Under the weight of mountains buried deep3
Themselves invaded next, and on their heads

Main promontories flung, which in the air

Came shadowing, and oppress’d whole legions arm’d;
Their armour help’d their harm, crush’d iu and bruis'd
Into their substance pent, which wrought them pain
Implacahle, and many a dolorous gruum ,

Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind
Out of such prison, though spirits of purest light,
Purest at first, 'now gross by sinning grown.

The rest, in imitation, to like arms

Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore:

, So hills amid the air encounter’d hills,

Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire3

That under ground they fought in dismal shade3
Infernal noise! war seemfd a civil garns

To this uproar3 horrid confusion haap'd

Upon confusion rose: and now all heaven

’ Had gone to wrack, with ruin overs'pread3

Had not the’ Almighty Father, where he sits

Shrin’d in his sanctuary oi heaven secure,

Consulting on the sunt of things, foreseen
This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd3
That his great purpose he might so fulfil,
To honour his anointed Son aveng'd
Upon his enemies, and to declare
