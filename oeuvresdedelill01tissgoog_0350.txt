340 Paeanisn eost, n. v.

Late fall'n himself from heaven, is plotting now
The fall of others from like state of bliss3
By violence? no, for that shall be withstood3

But by deceit and lies ε this let him know,
Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend.

Surprisal, unadmonish'd, unforewarn'd. a

So spake the' Eternal Father3 and fulfflt'd
All justice: nor delay'd the winged saint
After his charge receiv’d3 but hom among
Thousand celestial Ardors, where he stood
Veil’d with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,
Flew through the midst of heaven3 the' angelio quires,
On each hand parting, to his' speed gave way
Througb all the’ empyreal road; till, at tbe gete

of heaven arriv'd, the gate sels-open'd wide

On golden binges turning, as by work

Divina the sovran architeot had fram'd.

From henoe no cloud, or to obstruet his sight,

¹ Star interpos’d, however small he sees Ι

Not unconform to other shining globos, Ι
Eartb, and tbe garden of God, with cedars crown'd
Abone all hills. hs when by night the glass

of Galileo, less assur’d, observes

lmagin’d landa and regions in the m00n;

Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades
