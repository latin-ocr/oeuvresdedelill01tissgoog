202 PARADISE LOST, B. 111.

hs many as are testord, without thee none.
His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit,
Imputed‚ shall absolve them who renounee
Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee

. Receive new life. So man, as is most just,
Shall satisly for man, he judg’d and die,

And dying rise, and rising with him raise

llis brethren, ransom'd with his own dear lis .
So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate,
Giving to death, and dying 10 rcdeem3

So dearly to redeem whathellish hate

So easily destroy’d, and still destroys

ln those who, when they may, accept not grace.
Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume

Man’s nature, lessen or degrada thine own.

Because thou hest, ( though thron’d in highest bliss
Equal to God, and equally enjoying
God·like fruition‚ ) quittcd all to sava
Α world from utter loss, and hast been found
By merit more than birthright Son 01 God : ,
Found worthiest to be so by being good,
Far more than great or high3 because iu thee
Love hath abounded more than glory’ abounds,
Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt Ι
¹ With thee thy manhood also to this throne3
