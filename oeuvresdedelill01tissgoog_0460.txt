The punishment to other hand belongs 3
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appointss
Number to this day’s work is not ordain’d‚
Nor multitude; stand only, end behold
God’s indignation on these godless pour’d
By me; not you, but me, they have despis'd‚
Yet envied ; against meis all their rage,

Becaase the Father, to whom in heaven supreme

Kingdom, and power, and glory appennius,
Hath honour'd me, according to his will.
Therefore te me their doom he hath assign'd3
That they may have their wish, to try with me
ln battle which the stronger proves: they all,
Or l alone against them; since hy strength
They measure all, of other excellence

Not emulous, nor cere who them excels3

Nor other strife with them do l vouchsase, s

Se spake the Son, and into terrer chang'd
llis countenance too severe to be beheld,
And fullos wrath bent on his enemies.

’ At once the four spread out their starry wings
