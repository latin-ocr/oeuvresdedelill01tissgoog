210 PARADlSE LOST, B. ΙΙΙ. =

Thou drov’st ol warring Angels disarray'd.

Book from pursuit thy Powers with lond acolaim
Thee only extoll’d, Son of thy Father’s might,
To execute 'fierce rengeanee on his foes,

Not so on Man: Him, 'through their maline fall’n,
Father of merey and grace, thou didst not doom
So strictly, hut much more to pity' incline ε

No sooner did thy dear und only Son

Pereeive thee pmpos’d not to doom frail Man
So strictly, but much more to pity' inelin’d,
lle to appease thy wrath, and end the strife .
Of merey and justice in thy fuce discern'd,
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat

Second to thee, offer'd himself to die

For Man’s offence. Ο unexampled love!

Love no where to be found less than divine!

· Hail, Son of God l Saviour of men! Thy name

Shell be the eopious mutter of my song

Henoeforth, and never shall my hnrp thy praise
· Forget, nor from thy Tather’s praise disjoin. s

Thus they in lleaven, above the sturry sphere,
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
Meanwhile, upon the firm opacous globo ’

Of this round world, whose first eonvex divides
The luminous inferior orbs, enclos'd

From Chaos, and the inroad of Darlmess old,
Satan alighted walks: aglobe far off ,

’ lt seem’d, now seems a boundless continent
