298 PARADISE LOST, B. Ν.

Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,
ΑιιάΙ when we seek, as now, thy gist of sleep. n

This said unanimous, and other riter

’ Observing none, but odoration pure

Which God likes best, into their inmost bower
Handed they went; ond, eas’d the putting off
These troublesome disguises which wo wear, ·
Straight side by side were laid3 nor turn'd, l ween,
Adam from -his fair sponse, nor Eve the nites

· Mysteriousof oonnnhiallorereho'dr
Whatever hypocriten onsterely talk

Of purity, and piace, and innoeenee,

Defaming as impure what cod declares

Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.
'Our Moker ,bids increase t who bids ahstein,

But our, destroyer, foe to God and man?

Hail, wedded love, mysterious: law, true source
of human offspring, sole ,propriety

ln parodise of all things common else 2!

By thee adulterous lust was driven from men
hm0ng the bestial herde to ronge3 by thee
Foundedin reason, loyal, just, and pure,
Relations deor, and all the charities ¹ Α
Of father, son, and brother, 'first were known.
Far be’ it, thatl should write thee sin or blame,
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,
Perpetua} founrnin of domestic sweete,

Whose bed is undefil’d ond oheete pronouno'd,

Present or past, os saints and patriarohs us'd.
