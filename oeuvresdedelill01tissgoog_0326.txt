Leston the threshing·floor his hopeful sheaves

Prove ehaff. On'the’ other side, Satan, alarm'd,
Collecting all his might, dilated stood,

Like Teneriif 01 Atlas, unremov’d:

His stature reach’d the sky, and 011 his erest

Sat horror plumed3 nor wanted in his grasp

· What seem’d both spear and shield. Now dreadful ileeds

Might have ensued, ,nor only paradise

ln this commotior, but the starry cope

01 heaven perhaps, or all the elements

At least had gone to wrack, disturh’d and torn
With violence 01 this conflict, had not soon

The Etennal, to prevent such horrid iray,
Hung forth in heaven his golden scales, yet seen ⁴
Betwixt hstrea and the Scorpion sign,

“ Wherein all things created first he weigh'd,
The pendulous round earth with balane’d air

ln eounterpoise, now ponders all events,
Battles and realrns = in these he put two weights,
The seqnel each 01 parting and 01 ‘fight : Ι
The latter quick up flew, and hick'd the beam3
Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the fiend.

α Satan, Ι know thy strength, and thou know’st mine
Neither our own, bnt given: what folty then

To boast what arms ean do? since thine no more

Than heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now

To trampie thee as mire: 101 proof look up,
And read thy lot in yon celestini sign;
