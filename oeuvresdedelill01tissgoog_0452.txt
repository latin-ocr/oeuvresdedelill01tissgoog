To manifest thee worthiest to be heir

0f all thinga3 to he heir, and to he king

By sacred unction, thy deserved right.

Go then, thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might3
Ascend my ohariot, gulde the rapid wheels

, That shake heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,

My how and thnnder, my ahnighty arms
Gird on, and swerd upon thy puissant thigh ς
Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out
From all heaven's bounds into the atter deep:
There let them learn, as likes thern, to despise
God, and Messiah his anointed king. a

lle said, and on his Son with rays direct
Shone full3 he all his Father full express'd
lneffably into his face receiv’d3

And thus the filial Godhead anawering spake ε
α 0 Father, 0 supreme of heavenly throneS,

First, Highest, Holiest, Best! thou always seek’st
'lo glorify thy Son, Ι always thee,

hs is most just ε this l my glory’ account,

My exaltation, and my whole delight‚

That thou, in me well pleas’d, declar'st thy will
Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss.

Sceptra and power, thy giving, l assume,

And gladlier shall resign, when in the end

Thou shalt he all in all, and l in thee

For ever3 and in me all whom lov’st:
But whom thou hat'et, l hate, and can put on

’ Thy terrors, asl put thy mildnoss on,
