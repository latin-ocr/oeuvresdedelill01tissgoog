Vapours not yet into her substance tum'd.

Nor doth the moonno nourishment exhale

From her moist continent to higher orbs.

The sun, that light imparts to all, receives

From all his alimental recompense

ln humid exhalatione, and at even

Sups with the Ocean. Though in heaven the trees
ostile, ambrosial fruitage hear, and vines

Yield nectar3 though from off the houghs each morn
We hrnsh mellifluons dews3 and lind the ground
Cover'd with pearly grain ε yet God heth-here
Varied his bounty'so with new delights,

As may compare with heaven3 and to taste

and to their viands fell: nor seeminglp

The angel, nor in mist, (the common gloss

Of theologians ) but with keen dispatch

Through spirits with ease, nor wonder3 if hy fire
Ol sooty coal the' empyric alehemist

’ Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,

Metsls of drossiest ore to perfect gold,

hs from the mine. Meanwhile, at table Ere
Minister’d naked, and their flowing eups

With pleasant liquors crown’d. 0 innocenee
Deserving paradise! if ever, then,
