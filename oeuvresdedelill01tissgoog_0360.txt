Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess
This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower
To rest, and what the garden ohoioest bears
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat
Be orer, and the sun more eool decline. r Ι

Whom thus the angelis virtue answer’d mild.
a Adam, l therefore came; nor ert thou such
Created, or such place bast here to dwell,
As many not oft invite, though spirits of heaven,
To visit thee ι lead on then where thy bower
O'ershades3 for these mid-honre, till evening riso,
I have at will. s>

Ι So to the sylran lodge

They earne, that like Pomona's arbour smil’d,

With flowerets deok'd, and fragrant smells ε but Ere,

Undeok'd, sare with herself, more lovely fair
Than meod-nymph, or the fairest goddess feign'd
Of three that in mount lda naked strove,

Stood to’ entertain her guest from hesrom no rell
She needed, virtue-proof ; no thought infirm
Alter’d her' oheek. On whom the angel Harl
Bestow'd, the holy salutation us’d

Long after to blest llary, second Eve. ¹

α llail, mother of mankind, whose fruitful womb

Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons,
Than with these various fruits the trees of God

Have lreap’d this table.»
