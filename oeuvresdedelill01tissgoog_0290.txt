(ι sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two,
Imparadis'd in one another's arms,
The happier Eden, shalllenjoy their fill
of bliss on hliss3 while I to Hell am thrust‚
Where neither joy nor love, hut fierce desire,
Among our other tormenta not the least,
Still unfulfill’d, with pain ol longing pines·
Yet let me not forget what ἶ have gain'd
From their own mouths: all is not theim, it seems3
One fatal trec there stands of knowledge call’d‚
Forhidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidden?
suspicions, reasonless. Why should their Lord.
Enry thern that? Can it bc sin to know?
Can it he death! Assnd do they only stand
By ignorance? is that their happy state,
The proof ol their ohedience and their saith?
Ο fair foundation laid whereon to build
Their ruint Hence l will excite thcrr minds
With more desire to know and to reject
Envions commands, invented with design
To keep thern low, whom knowledge might exalt
Equal with Gods: aspiring to he such,

They taste and die: what likelier can eosne?

Ι But first with narrow search l must walt round

This gardan, and no corner leave unspied3
