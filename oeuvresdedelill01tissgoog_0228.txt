ata = rauamsn iosr, n. 111.
Embellish’d3 thick with sparkling orient gems

The portal shone, inirpitahle on earth '

By model, or ΒΥ shading peneil, drawn.

The stairs were such, as whereon Jacob saw
Angels aseending and descending, hands

Of guardians bright, when hesrom Esau ssed
To radan-Aram, in the field of Luz,

Dreaming ΒΥ night under the open sky,

And waking oried ε This is the gate of Heaven l
Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
There always, hut drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Α Viewless3 and underneath ahright sea flow'd
Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon

Who aster came from earth, sailing arriv’d,

Wafted ΒΥ Angels, or ssew 0'er the lake
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.

The stairs were then let down, whether to dare

The Fiend ΒΥ easy' ascent, or aggravato

His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss:
Direct against which open'd from beneath‚
Just o’er the blissful seat of Paradise,

Α passage down to the' Earth, a passage wide,
Wider ΒΥ far than that of after-times

Over mount Sion and, though that were large,
Over the Promis’d Land, to God so dear;

ΒΥ which, to risit oft those happy tribes,

On high behests his Angels to and fro

Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choico regard

From paneae, the sount os Jordan's ssood,
