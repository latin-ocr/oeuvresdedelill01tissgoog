Bending to look on me z l started back,
lt etarted back3 but pleas’dl soon return’d‚
Pleas'd it r‘eturn'd as soon with'answering looks

Of sympathy and love ε there l had fix'd

Mine eyes till now, and pin’d with vain desir'e, 1

Had not a voice thus-warn'd me : α What thou seest,
What there thou seest‚ sair creature, is thysell ;
With thee it came and goes ι but follow me,

Andl will bring thee where no shadow stays

Thy coming, and thy soft embraces3 he

Whose image thou art, him thou shalt enjoy
lnseparably thine, to him shalt bear

Multitudes like thyself, and thence he call’d⁸
Mother of human raoe. ι»

What ooultl l do,
ι But ‘follow straight, invisibly thus led?

mn espied thee, fair indeed ana tan, ·
Under a plantatim yet methought less fair,

Less winning solt, less amiahly mild,

Than that smooth watery image: back l tum’d3
Thou following ery'dst aloud ε lterum, fair Eve,
Whom ily'st thou? whom thou· lly’st, ol him thou art,
