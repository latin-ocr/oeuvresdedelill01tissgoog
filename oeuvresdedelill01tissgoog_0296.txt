286 PARADISE tostjss. lV.

On purpose, hard thou know‘st it to exclude

· Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.

But if within the circuit ol these wallis,

ln whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom

Thou tell’st, by morrow dawning 1 shall know. »

So promis’d he; and Uriel to his charge

Return'd on that bright boam, whose point how rais'd
Bore him slope downward to tlte sun now fall’n

. Beneath the Azores3 whether the prime orb,

Incredible how swift, had thither roll'd
Diurnal‚ or this less voluhil earth,

By shorter ssight to the’ east, had left him there,
Arraying with 'reflected purple' and gold

The clouds, that on his western throne attend.
Now came still evening on, and twilight gray
Had in her sober livery all things elad3

Silence accompanied: lor beast and bird,

They to their grassy conch, these to their nests
Were slunl, all but the wakefulnightingale3
'She all night long her amorous descant sung3
Silence was pleas’d: now glow'd the firmament
With living sapphiros: Hesperus, that led

The starry host, rode brighton, till the moon,
Rising in clouded majesty‚ at length

Apparent queen unveil’d her peerless light,
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.
