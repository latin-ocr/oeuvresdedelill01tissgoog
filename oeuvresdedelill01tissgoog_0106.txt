96 PARADISE LOST, B. ll. ’

Thus high uplisted beyond hope, aspires
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue Ι
Vain war with Heaven3 and, by success untaught,

His proud imaginations thus display’d.

α Powers and dominions, deities os lienem
For since no deep within hei· gulf ean hold¹
lmmortal rigour, though oppress’d and fallu,
l give not lleaven lor lost. Fromthis descent ,
Celestial virtues rising, will appear
More glorious and more dread than from no fall, ’

And trust themselves to sear no second fate.
Me though just right, and the fix’d laws of Hoeven,

Did firstcreate your leader3 next, free choice,
With what besides, in counsel or in fight,

Hath been adiiev’d of merit; yet this loss,
Thus far at least reoover’d, hath much more
Establish’d in a sate unenvied throne,

Yielded with full consent, The happier state

. ln Heaven, which follows dignhy, might draw

Envy from eaoh inferior3 but who here

Will envy whom the highest place exposes
Foremost to stand against the Thunderer’s aim,
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share
Of endless pain? Where there is then no good
For which to strive, no strise can grow up there
From saction3 for none sure will olaim in llell

ἵ Procedence3 none, whose portion is so small
