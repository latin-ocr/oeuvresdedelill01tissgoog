426 PARADISE LOST, B. Vl.

This continent of spacious heaven, adorn'd

With plant, fruit, llowcr nmbrosial, gems, aud gold:
Whosc eye so superficiully surveys

These things, as not to mind from whence they grow
Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,

Of spiritous and fiery spume, till, touch'd

With heavcn's ray, and temper’d, they shoot lorth
So beauteous‚ opening to the ambient light?

These their darlr nativity the deep

Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame3
Which, into hollow engines, long and round,
Thick ramm'd, nt the' other hore with touch ol lire
Dilated anyl infuriatc, shall send forth

From far, with thundering noise, among our focs
Such implements of mischief, as shall dash

To pieces, and o’erwhehn whatever stands

Adverso, that they shall fear we have disarm'd

The thunderer ol his only dreaded holt.

Nor long shall he our labour3 yet ere dawn,

Effect shall end our wish. Meanwhile revivat
Abandon fear3 to strength and connsel join'd

Think nothing hard, much less to be despair’d. n

lle ended, and his words their drooping cheer
Enlighten’d, and their languish’d hope reviv'd.

The' invention all admir’d, and each, how he

To he the' inventor miss’d ε so easy it scem'd

Onccnfouud, which'yet unfoundjmost would have thought
