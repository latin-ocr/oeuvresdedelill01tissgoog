188 PARADISE LOST, B. 111.

Sole pledge of his obedience: so will lall

He and his laithless progeny. ‘Whose fault?
Whose hut his own? Ingrato, he had of mc ’
All he could have3 Imade him just and right,
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.

Such I created all the’ ethereal Powcrs

And Spirits, both them who stood, and them who lail¹d;
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.

Not free, what proof could they have given sincere
of true allegiance, constant saith or love,

Where only what they nceds must do appear’d‚

Not what they would? what praise could they receive?
What pleasure l from suchohedience paid,

When will and reason (reason also' is. choice)
Uscless and vain, of freedom both despoil'd,

Made passive both, had serv'd necessity,

Not me? They therefore, as to right balonga,

So were created, nor can justly' accuse

Their maker, or their making, or their fate,

Asis predestination over-rul’d

Their will, dispos’d by absolute decree

Or high loreknowledg03 they themselves decrecd

Their own revolt, not 13 ift foreknew,

Foreltnowledgc had no influence on their fault,

Which had no less prov’d certain unforeknown.
So'jwithout least impulse or shadow of late,

Or aught by me immutably forcsecn,

They trespass, authors to, themselves inall

Both what they judge, and what they choose;-sor so
