216 PthDlSE LOST, B. lll.
And they, who to he sure ofParndise,

¹ Dying, put on the weeds ol Dorniniels,

Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd3

They pass the planets seven, and pass the hx'd,
And that cryslalline sphere whose balance weighs
The trepidation talk’d, and that first mov'd3

And now Saint Peter at, Heeven's wielet seems
To weit them with his heys, and now at foot

Of Hoeven’s necent 'they list their leet, when lo!

A violent oross windfrom either eoest ¹

Blows thern transverse, ten thousand leugues ewry
lnto the devious air3 then might ye see

Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their weerers, test

And ssutter’d into regs3 then reliques, beads,

· Indulgences, dispenses, perdens, hulls,

The sport of winde ε all these, upwhirl’d ulolt,
. Fly o'er the back side ol the world lar off,
lnto aLimbo large and broad, since oell’d
The Paradise of Fools3 to few unknown

Loug efter, now unpeopled and unu-od. “

ΑΗ this dark globo the Fiend found es he pass’d,
And long he wander'd, till at last a gleam

Of dunning light turn'd thither-word in haste

llis travell’d steps : far distant he deseries
Ascending hy degrees magnificent

Up to the wall of Hoeven a structure high3
At top whereol‚ hut far more rich, oppeer'd
The work os of a k'ingly pollice-gete,

With frontispieee of diamond ond gold
