Darts his experienc’d eye, and soon traversa

The whole batalion riews3 their order due;
Their visages and stature as of Gode; '

Their number last he sums. And now his heart
Distends with pride, and hardening in his strength
Glories: formarer, since created man,

Met such imbodied force, as nam’d with these
Could merit more than that small infantry

Ι Warr'd on hy cranes: though alt the giant brood.
0f Phlegra with the’ heroic race were join’d

That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side
Mix'd with auxilior Gods3 and what resounds
ln fable and romanoe, ofUther’s son ’

’ Begirt with British and Armorie knights3

And all who since, baptiz’d or infidet
Jousted in Aspramont‚ or Montalban, -
Damasco, or Marocco‚ or Trebisond‚

Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore,
When Charlemain wim all his peerage felt:
By Fontarabbia.

’ Thus far these beyond
Compare of mortal prowess‚ yet observ‘d
Their dread Commender: he, above the rest
ln shape and gesture proudly eminent,
Stood like a tower3 his form had yet not lost
