36ss PARADlSE LOST, B. V.

Of hierarchies, of orders, and degreee3 ·
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblaz’d
Holy memoriam, acts of zeal and love

Recorded eminent.

Thus when in drbs

Of circuit inexpressible they stood,

Orb within orb, the Father infinite,

By whom in bliss imbosom'dsat the son,

Amidst as fromn flaming mount, whose top

Brightness had made invisible, thus spake :—
allear‚ all ye angels, progeny of light,

Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers,

Hear my deeree, which unrevok’d shall stand.

This dayl have begot whom l deelare

My only son, and on this holy hill

llim have anointed, whom ye now behold

At my right hand3 your headl him appoint:

And by myself have sworn, to him shall bow

All knees in heaven, and shall confess him Lord‚

Under his great viee-gerent reign abide

United, as one individual seul,

For ever happy: him who disobeys‚

Me desobeys‚ breaks union, and that day,

Cast out from God‚ and blessed vision, falls

lnto' utter darkness, deep inguli‘d‚ his place

Ordain’d without redemption, without end. n
«So spele the Omnipotent‚ and with his words

hll seem’d well pleas'd; all seem’d, but where not all.

That day, as other solemn days, they spent
