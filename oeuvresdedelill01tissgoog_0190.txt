180 PARADISE LOST, B. Ill.

May 1 express thee’ unblam'd? since God is light,
And never hut in unapproached light

Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee,

Bright effldence of bright essence increato.

Or hear'st thou rather, pure ethereal stream,
Whose fountain who shall tell? Before the sun,
Before the Heavens thou wert, and attho voice
of God, as with amande, didst invest

The rising world of waters dark and deep,

Won from the void and formless infinite. ¹

Thee l revisit now with holder iring,
Eseap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain’d
In that obscure· sojourn, while in my ssight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne
With other notes than the’ Orphean lyre,
Ι sung of Chaos and eternal Night3
Taught by the hearonly Muse to venture down ,
The dark descent, and up to rte-aseend,
Though hard and rare z theol revisit safe,
And seel thy sorren vital lamp3 but thou
Revisit'st not these eyes, that roll in rain
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn3
So thick a drop serene hath quenoh'd their orbs,
