162 PhRADlSE LOST‚ B. 11.

The gods who live at ease, where 1 shall reign
ht thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems

Thy daughter and thy derling, without end. a

Thus saying, from her side the fatal hey,
Sad instrument of all our woe‚ she took3
and, towards the gate rolling her bestial train,
Forthwith the huge portcullis high up drew,
Which hut herself, not all the Stygian powers
Could once have mov'd3 then in the hey-hold turns
‘she’ intricate words, aud every holt aud bar »
01 massy iron or solid rock with ease
Unfastens. On asudden open ily
With impetuous recoil aud jarring sound
The’ infernal doors, and on their hinges grate
Harsh thunder, that the lowest hottom shook
01 Erehus. She open’d, hut to shut
Excell’d her power3 the gates wide open stood,
That with extended wings a benner’d host,
Under spread ensigns marching, might pass through
With horse and ohariots rank’d in loose arrayt

So wide they stood, and like a fornace-mouth

Cast forth redeunding smoke and ruddy flante.

Before their yes in sudden view appear
The secrets oi the hoary deep3 a dark
lllimitable ocean, without bound,
