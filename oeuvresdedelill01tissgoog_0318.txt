308 Ph'RthSE LOST, ll. lv,

And with them comes a third of regal port,
But faded splendour wan3 who by his gait

And fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell,
Not likely to part hence without contest;
Stand linn, for in his look delianoe lours.

He scaree had ended, when those two approach’d‚
And brief related whom they brought, where found,
How busied, in what form and posture couch'd.
To whom with stcrn regard thus Gabriel spake. .
«Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescrib’d
To thy transgressions‚ and disturb'd the charge
Of others, who approve not to transgress
By thy example, but have power and right
To question thy bold entrance on this place;
Employ'd, it seems, to violate sleep‚ and those
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in blissi'»

To whom thus Satan, with contemptuous brow.

« Gabriel! thou hadst in heaven the esteem of wise,
and such I held thee, but this question ash’d
Puts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain?

Who would not, finding way, break loose from hell,
Though thither doom’d? Thou wouldst thyself‚ no doubt,

And boldly venture to whatever place
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change

Torment with ease, and soonest recompenso
Dole with delight‚ which in this place l sought3
To thee no reason, who know'st only good,

But evil hast not tried: and wilt object t
His will who bounds us? Let him surer bar
