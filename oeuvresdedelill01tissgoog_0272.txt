Not equal, as their sex not equnl seem'd3
For contemplation he and valour form’d ε
For softness she and sweet attractive grace;
He for God only, she lor God in him.

His fair large front und eye sublime declar'd
Absolute rule; and hyacinthino looks
Round from his parted forelook manly hung
Clustering‚ but not beneath his shoulders broad ι
She, as a veil‚ down to the slender waist
Her unadorned golden tresses wore
Dishevell'd‚ but in wanton ringleto wav'd
As the vine curls hor tundirin, which impliod
Suhjection, but requir'd with gentle sway‚
And by her yielded, by him best reooiv’d3
t'ielded with coy submissim, modest pride,

And suunt, reluctant, amorous delay.

Nor those mysterious parts wore then conceal’d3

Then was not guilty silasne, dishonest shame
Os nature's works, honour dishonourable‚

Sin-bned, how have ye troubled all mankind
