420 ptutntst eost, B. vt.

Defensive marce, or wius pale leur· surpris'd,
Then first with fear surpris'd, and sense ol 'pain
Fled ignominiouS, to such evil brought
By sin of disobedience: till that hour
Not liahle to sear, or ssight, or pain.

Far otherwise the' inviolable saints,
lu cubic phalanx firm, advanc’d entire,

lnvulnerahle‚ impenetrably arm'd3

Such high advantage their innoeenee

Gave theru above their foes3 not to have sinn'd,

Not to have dlaohey'd3 iu fight they stood
Unwearied, uuobnoxious to be puiu'd ,

By wound‚ though from their place by violence mov'd.

Nou night her course began, and over heaven
Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos’d‚

And silence on the odious din of war :

Under her cloudy corort both retir’d,

Victor and tunquish’d3 on the foughten field
Michael and his ungels prevalent

Encamping, plac’d in guard their warum round,
Cherubic waving fires: on the’ other part,

Satan with his rebellious disappear’d‚ .

Fur iu the dark dislodg’d3 and, void of rest,

His potentates to council call'd by night3

And in the midst thus undismay'd began:

a Ο now in danger tried, now known in arms
Not to he overpower’d‚ companions deur,
Found worthy not of liberty alone,

'l'oo mean pretence! but what ue more effect,
