By me upheld, that he may know how frail

llis fall’n condition in, and to me owe

All his deliverance, and to none but me.

Some l hire chosen of peculier grace,

Ι Elect above the rest; so is my will.

The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn’d
Their sinful state, and to appense betimes
The' incensed Deity, while oller'd grace
Invites3 sorl will clear their senses dark,
What moy suffice, and sosten stony hearts

To pmy, repent, and bring obedienoe due.

To prayer, repentance‚ and obedience due,
Though but endeavour’d with sincere intent,
Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
And I will place within them as a guide‚ -
My tnnpire‚ conscience3 whom if they will hear,
Light after light, well us’d, they shall attain,
And to the end, persisting, sate arrivs.

This my long sollemne, and my day of grace,
They who neglect and soom, shall never tastez
But hard be harden'd‚ blind be blinded more,
That they may stumble on, and deeper lall3

And none but such from mercy 1 exclude.

But yet all is not done3 man disobeying‚

Disloyal, breaks his feslty‚ and sins
Ageinst the high supremacy ol Hoeven,
Affecting God·head, and, so losing alt·
To expiate his treason bath nought left,
but to destruction sacred end devote, ,
