rra remorsa eosr, a. 11.
The lip of Tantalus.

Thus roving on ¹
ln consus'd march forlorn‚ the' adventurous bands
With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,
View’d first their lamentable lot, and found
No rest ε through many a dark and dreary vale
They pass’d, and many a region dolemus,
O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp,

Roeks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs‚ dens, and sbades of death, 1
Α universe of death l which God by curse

Created evil, for evil only good,
Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds‚

Perverse, all monstrous‚ all prodigious things,

Than sables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv'd,

Abominable, inutterable, and worse

Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chinaeras dire.
