440 PARADISE Losv, B. VI.

all power on him transserr'd: whence to his son, ' v
The assessor os his throne, he thus began:
«Effulgence os my glory, Son helov'd,

Son, in whose face invisible is behold

Visihly, what hy Deity l am;

And in whose hand what hy decree 1 dc,

Second Omnipotence! two days are past,

Two days, as we compute the days of heaven,

Since Michael and his power went forth to tame

These disobedient: sore hath been their sight,

As likoliest was, when two such foes met arm'd3-

For to themselves sl left them3 and thou know’st,

Equal in their creation they were form’d‚

Save what sin hath impeir'd3 which yet hath wrought

lnsensibly, iorl suspend their doom3

Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last

Endless, and no solution will be found :

War wearied heth perform’d what war can do, ,

And to disorder²d rage let loose the seins,

With mountains‚ as with weapons‚ arm’d3 which makes
’ Wild work in heaven, and dangerous to the main.

Two days are therefore past, the third is thine ;¹

For thee 1 have ordain’d it3 and thus far

Have suffer'd, that the glory may he thine

Of ending this great war, since none hut thou

Can end it. Into thee such virtue and grace

hnmense 1 have transfus'd, that all may know
ln heaven and hell thy power above compare 3-
And, this perverse commotion govern'd thus„
