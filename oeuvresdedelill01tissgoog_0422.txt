412 PARADISE LOST, B. VI.

01 airy threats to awo, whom yet with deeds

Thou canst not. Hast thou turn'd the least 01 these
To ssight, or 11 to fall, but that they rise
Unvanquish'd, easier to transact with me

That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats
To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end

The strise which thou call’st evil, but we style

The strife 01 glory; which we mean to win,

Or turn this heaven itself into the hell

Thou sablest3 herc however to dwelf free,

11 not to reign: meanwhile thy utmost force,

And join him nam’d Almighty to thy aid,

1 111 not, but have sought thee far and nigh. 1

They ended parle, and both address'd for fight

Unspeakahle3 for vhe, though with the tongue

01 angele, can relate, orto what things

Liken on carth conspicuouS, that may list
Human imagination to such heighth

01 godlike power? sor likest Gods they seem’d,
Stood they or mov’d, in stature, motion, arms,

Fit to decide the empirc 01 great heaven.

Now wav’d their fiery swords, and in the air
Made horrid circles3 two broad suns their shields
Blaz’d opposite, while expectation stood
111 horror 3 from each hand with speed retir'd‚
Where erst was thickcst fight, the’ angelic throng,
And test large field} unsafe within tae wad
