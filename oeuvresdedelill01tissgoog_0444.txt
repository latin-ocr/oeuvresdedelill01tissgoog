Which to our eyes discover’d, new and strange,
Α triple mounted row ol pillars laid

On wheels (for like to pillsrs most they seem'd,
Or hollow’d bodies made of oak or fir,

With branchos lopt, in wood or mountain fell’d,)
Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their months
With hideous orifice gnp'd on us wide,
Portending hollow struce ε at each behind

Α seraph stood, and in his hand a reed

Stood waving tipt with firs3 while we, suspense,
Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, ⁸
Not long3 for sudden all at once their reeds

Pnt forth, and to a narrow vent applied

With nicest touch. immediate in n dame,

But soon obscur'd with smoke, all heaven appear'd,

From those deep-threated engines belch’d, whose roar

Emhowell’d with outrageous noise the air,

And all her entrails tore disgorging foul

Their devilish glut, chnin’d thunderholts and hail
Of iron globes3 which, on the victor-host
Levell’d, with such impetuons lury smote,

That whom they hit, none on their leet might stand,
Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell
By thousands, angel on arch-angel roll’d3

The sooner for their arms; unarm’d they might

. Have easily, as spirits, evaded swist

By quick contractiori or remove3 hut now

Fonl dissipation followld, and forc'd rout;

1 Nor serv'd it to relax thcir serried illes.
