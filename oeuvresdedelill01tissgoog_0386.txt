376 PARADISE LOS'l', B. V.
With speed what soree is left, and all employ

ln our desence; lest unawares we lose
This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill. n
(ι Το whom the son with calm aspect and clear,

Lightning divine, ineffable, serene,

Made answer: - α Mighty Father, thou thy foes

Justly hast in derision, and, secure,

Laugh'st at their vain designs and tumults vain,
Matter to me of glory, whom their hate ·
Illustrates, when they see all regal power

s Given me to quell their pride, and in event
Know whether 1 be dertrons to subdue ⁸

. ' Thy rebels, or be found the worst in heaven. a

a So spahe the son, but Satan, with his powers,
Far was advane'd on winged speed3 an host
Innumerable as the stars of night,

Or stars of morning, dew-dropS, which the sun
lmpearls on every leaf and and every flower.
Regions they pass'd‚ the mighty regeneies

Of seraphim, andpotentates, and thrones,

In their triple degrees; regions to which

All thy dominion, Adam, is no m'ore

Than what this garden is to all the earth,

And all thesea, from one entire globoso
Streteh'd into longitude3 which having, pass'd,
At length into the limits of the north

They came3 and Satan to his royal seat

High on a hill, far blazing‚ asa mount

Rais'd on amount, with pyramids and tovers
