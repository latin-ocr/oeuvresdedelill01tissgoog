238 PARADISE LOS'l, B. lV.

Then when the Dragon, put to second ront,
Came furious down to be reveng'd'on men,

W οι to rte inhabitants oa earth! that now,

While time was, our first parents had been warn'd
The coming of their secret foe, and 'scap'd,
Haply so 'scap'd his mortal snare: lor now

Satan, now first inflam’d with rage, came down,

The temptor ere the' accuser of mankind,

To wreak on innocent srail man his loss
Of that first battle, and his ssight to hell:
Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, though hold,

Far off and scarless», nor with cause to boast,
Bagins his dire attempt3 which nigh thc birth,
Now rolling hoils in his tumultuous breast,

And like a devilish engine back recoils

Upon himself 3 horror and donht distract

His troubled thoughts, and from the hottom stir
The hell within him; for within him hell

He brings, and round about him, nor from hell
One step, no more than from himself, can fly

By change of place: now conscience wales despair,
That slumher'd3 wakes the hitter‘ memory

Of what he was, what is, and what must be
Worse3 of worse decds worse sufferings must ensue.

Sometimes towards Edon, which now in his view
Lay pleasant, his griev'd look he fixos sad;
