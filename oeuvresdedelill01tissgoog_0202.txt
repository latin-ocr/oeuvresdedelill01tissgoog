Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd
With his own follyl That be from thee far,
That far be from thoe, Father, who art judge ’

Of all things made, and judgest only right. ι

Or shall the Adversary thus obtain Ι
His end, and frustrate thine? shall he fulfil
llis malice, and thy goodness bring to nought,

Or proud return, though to his heavier doom,
Yet with revenge accomplish’d, and to hell
Draw after him the whole race of mankind,

By him corrupted? or wilt thou thysels

Abolish thy creation, and unmalte

For him, what for thy glory thou host made?
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
Be question'd and blasphem'd without defense. υ

, To whom the great Creator thus replied:
«Ο Son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone

My word, my wisdo'm, and effectual might,
hll hast thou spoken, as my thoughts are, all
hs my eternal purpose hath decreed:

Man shall not quitebe lost, but sav'd who will;
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me ¹

Freely rouchsal'd3 once more l will renew
His'lapsed powers, though forfeit, and inthrall’d
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;

Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand
On even ground against his mortal ioe;
