62 PARADISE LOST, B. 1.

Within his sanctunry itself their obtines,
Abominations, and with cursed things
His holy rites and solemn feasts profan'd‚
And with their darkness durst affront his light.

First, Moloch, horrid king, besmcar'd with blood
of human sacrifice, and parents' tears3
Though for the noise of drnms and timbrels loud
Their children’s eries unheard, that pass'd through tire

To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite

Worshipt in Rabba and her watery plain,

In Argob and in Basan, to the stream

0f utmost Arnon: nor content with such
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest beart

Of Salomon he led by fraud to buiid

His temple right against the temple’ of God,
On that opprobrious hill; and made his grove
The pleasant valley of Hinnom‚ Tophet thence

“ And black Gehenna call'd‚ the type of Hell.

Next, Chemos, the obscene dread of Moab’s sons, =
For Aroar to Nebo, and the wild
Of southmost Abarim, in Hesebon
tnd Horonaim‚ Soon’s realm, beyond
The ssowery daie of Sibma clad with vines,
and Eleald to the' Asphaltic pool.
Peor his other name, when he entic'd'
lsrael in Sinin, on their march from Nile,
To do him wanton ritcs, which cost them woe.
Yet thence his lustful orgics he cnlarg’d,
Even to that hill of scandal‚ by the grove
