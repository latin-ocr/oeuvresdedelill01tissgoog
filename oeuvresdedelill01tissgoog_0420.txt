Intestina war in heaven, the arch-foe sobdued

Or captive dragg’d in chains, with hostile frown

And visage all inflam'd, first thus began:

a huthor of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
Unnam'd in heaven, now plenteous, as thou seest
These acts of hateful strife, hateful to alt,

Though heaviest hy just measure on thyself,
And thy adherente: how hast thou disturh'd
Heaven’s blessed peace, and into nature brought
Misery uncreated. till the crime

Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instill'd

Thy maline into thousands, once upright

And faithful, now prov'd fahe! but think not here
To trouble holy rest3 heaven casts thee out
From all her confines : heaven, the seat of bliss,
Brooks not the works of violence and war.
Hence then, and evil go with thoe along,

Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;

Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broile,

⁸ Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,

Or some more sudden wengeance, wing'd from God,

Precipitate thee with augmented pain. n

So spake the prinoe of engels3 to whom thus

The adversary z
« Nor think thou with wind
