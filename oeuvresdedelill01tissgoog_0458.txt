Each to his placer they heard his voice, end went

Obsequious3 heaven his wonted iace renew'd,

And with fresh ssowerets hill and valiey smil'd.

This sew his hapless ioes, but stood obdur’d,
And to rebellious fight rallied their powers,
insensate, hope conoeiving from despair.
in heaveniy spirits could such perverseness dweli’
But to convince the proud‚ what sings avail,

Or wonders move the’ obdurate to celent?
They, herden'd inore by what might most reciairn,
Grieving to sec his glory, at the sight

Took envy3 and aspiring to his heighth,
Stood rc-ernbattled sterce, by force or fraud

Weening to prosper, and at le‘ngth prevaii
Ageinst God and Messiah, or to sall

ln universal ruin last3 and now

To final battle drew, disdaining ssight,

Or faint retreat3 when the great son of God
To all his host on either hand thus spake :

α Stand still in bright array, ye saints3 herc stand.
Ye engeis arm’d; this day from battle rest;
Fuithfulmh been your warfare, and ol'God
Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;
And es ye have receiv'd, so have ye done,
lnvineibl y : but of this cursed crcw
