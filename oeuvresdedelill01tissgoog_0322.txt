Thy fiereest, when in battle to thy aid “
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed,
An seconded thy else not dreaded spear.
But still thy words at randum, as before,
Argue thy inexperienee what behoves

From hard assays and ill suecesses past

Α faithful leader, not to hazard all
Through ways of danger by himself untried : Ι
l, therefore, l alone first undertook

To wing the desolate abyss, and spy

This new-created world, whereof in hell
Fame is not silent, bere in hope to find
Better abode, and my afflicted powers

To settle here on earth, or in mid air3

Though for possession put to try once more

What thou and thy gay legions dare against3

Whose easier business were to serve their lord
¹ High up in heaven, with songs to hymn his throne
And practis’d distanees to cringe, not light. n

To whom the warrior-angel soon replied.
«To say and straight unsay, pretending first
Wise to lly pain, professing next the spy,
Argues no leader but a liar trac'd,
Satan, and couldst thou 'faithful’ add? Oname‚
Ο sacred name of faithfulness profan’d!
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellione crew?
Army of fiends, fit body to lit head.
Was this your discipline and saith engag’d, ·
Your military' obedienee, to dissolve
