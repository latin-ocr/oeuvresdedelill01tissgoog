42 rananrsu cosi, B. 1.

Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee, and deify his power,
Who from the terror of this arm so latev
Doubted his empire3 that were low indeed,
That were an ignominy, and shame beneath
This downfall: since, by fate, the strength of Gods
And this empyreal substance cannot fail ε

Since through experieuce of this great event,
ln arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’d,
We may with more successful hope ,resolve

To wege by force or guile eternal war,
Irreconcilcable to our grand foe,

Who now triumphs, and, in the’ excess ofjoy

Sole reigning, holds the tyranny of Heaven. a

So spake the apostate Angel, though in pain,
Vaunting aloud, but rack’d with deep despair ε
And him thus answer’d soon his bold compeer.

α Ο Prince, 0 Chief of mahy 'throned Powers‚
That led the’ embattled Seraphim to war
Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds

Fearless, indanger'd Heaven's perpetual king,
And put to proof his high supremacy,

Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or sate3
Too well 1 see, and rue the dire event,

That with sad overthrow, and foul defeat,

Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host

ln horriblo destruction laid thus low,
