aa sanantes sosr, s. 1.

Say first, for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,
Nor the deep tract ol Hella say first, what cause
Mov'd our grand parents, in that happy state,
Favour’d of Heaven so highly, to fall off

. From their Creator, and transgress his will

For one restraint, lords ol the world besides?
⁸ Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?
The’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile,

Stirr’d up with envy and revenge, deceiv'd
The-mother of mankind, what time his pride ,
Had east him out from Heaven, with all his host

Os rebel angele, hy whose aid aspiring

To set himself ln glory' above his pears,

He trusted to have equall’d the Most High,

lf he oppos'd3 and with ambitious aim

Against the throne and monarchy of God,

· Rais'd impious war in Heaven, and battle proud,

With vain attempt! nim the hlmighty Power,
Hurl'd headlong flaming from the’ ethereal sky,
With hideous ruin and combustion, down “
Το hottomless perdition3 there to duell

In adamantino chains and penal fire,

Who durst dely the’ Omnipotent to arms.

Nino times the space that measures day and night
To mortal men, he with his horrid orew

Lay vanquish'd, rolling in the fiery guli,
Confounded, though immortal: but his doom

’ Reserv’d him to more wrath 3 for now the thought,
Both of loa happiness and lasting pain, , .
