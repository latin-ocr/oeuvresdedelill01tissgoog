From diamond quarries hewn, and rocks os gold;
The palene oi great Lucifer, (so cell

That structure in the dialect of men

Interpreted) which not long alter, he

Affecting all equality with God,

Messiah was declnr’d in sight of heaven h

For thither he assembled all his train,
Pretending so commanded to consult

About the great reception of their Kin'g,

Thither to come, and with calumnious art

Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.

Not merely titulat, since by decree

Another now hath to himself ingross’d -

All power, and us eclips'd under the name

Of midnight-march, end hurried meeting here,

This only to consult how we may best,

With what may hc devis’d of honours new,

Receive him, coming to receive from us

Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!

To one, end to his image now proeleim’d?

But wlmt &better coumels might erent

Our minds, aud teneh us to castoli this yoke?

Will ye submit your neeks, and choose to bend
