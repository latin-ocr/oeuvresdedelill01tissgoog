The vassals of his anger, when the soourge
lnexorably, and the torturing hour

Calls us to penance? More destroy'd than thus,
We shall be quite abolish'd, and expire.

What fear we then? what doubt we to incense
His utmost ire? which, to the heighth enrag'd,
will either quite consumens, and reduce

To nothing this essential, happier far

Thau miserable to have eternal being:

Or, if our substance be indeed divine,

And cannot cease to be, we are at worst

On this side nothing3 and hy proof we feel
Our power sufficient to disturb his Hearen,
And with perpetual inroads to alarm,

. Though inaccessihle, his fatal throne:

Which, if not victory, is yet revenge. a

He ended frowning„ and his look demunt-'d
Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous
To less than gods. On the' other- side uprose
Belial, in act more gracesul and humane:
, Α fairer person lost not Heaven3 he seem'd
For dignity compos'd, and high exploit:
But all was false-and hollow3 though his tongue
Dropt manna, and could make the worse appear

The better reason, to perplex and dash

Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were lot¹t3¹ ,

To vice industrious, hut to nohler decdo
