248 PARADISE LOST, B. tv.

Saw him disfigur'd, morethen could befall
Spiritssof happy sort: his gestures heroe
He mark’d end mad denteenour, then aione,

As he suppos'd‚ all unobserv’d, unseen.

Soson he fares, end to the border comes
Of ¹Edon, where delicious Paradiee,
Now neerer, crowns with her enclosure green,
As with e rural mound, the champaign head
Of e eteep wilderness, whose hairy sides ,
With thicket overgrown, grotesqueend wito,
Access denied3 and over-head up grew
Insupereble height of loftiest shade,·
Cedat, end pino, and fir, and branching palm,
Asylwan soene3 and as the ranke ascend ,
Shede above shede, e woody theatro
Of steteliest view. Yet higher than their tops
The werdurous wall of Peredise up sprung ε
Which to our general siregeve prospect large
lnto his nether empire neighbouringround:
And higher than that wella cirelhtg row
Of goodliest trees, loeden with fairest fruit,
Blossoms end imits at once of golden hue,
Appeer'd, with gay enamell’d coulours mix'd:
On which the sun more glad impress'd his beams -
Then in seir evening cloud, or humid how,
When God heth shower’d the earth3 so lovely seem’d
That landscape= end of pure, now purer air
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires
Vernal detight end joy, able to drive
