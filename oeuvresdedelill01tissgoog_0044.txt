Brought death into the world, and all our wne,
wnhloss ofnden,ti110negreaternan ’
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,

Sing, heavenly Muse! that on the secret top

Os Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire

That shepherd, who first taught the chosen seed,
ln the beginning, how the Heavens and Earth
Rose out of Chaosz Or, if sion-hill

Delight thee more, and Siloa’s brook that 'ssow'd
Fast hy the orncle of God: l thence

Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,

that with no middle night intends to soar

Above the’ Aonian mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme. ' ,
tnd chiefly thou, Ο Spirit! that dost prefer ’ ’
Before all temptes the' upright heart and pure,
Instruct me,¹ for Thou know’st3 Thou from the first
Wast present, and with mighty wings out-spread,
Bone-like sat'st brooding on the vast abyss,¹

nnd mad’st it pregnant: what in me is dark,
lllumine3 what is low, raise and support ;

That to the heighth of this great argument

1 may assent eternal Providence‚

And justify the ways of God to men. v
