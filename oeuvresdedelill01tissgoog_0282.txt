272 PARADISE LOST‚ Β. IV.-

Grip'd in each paw: when Adam, first of men.

A Το first os women, Ere, thus moving speech,

Turn’d him all ear to hear new utteranoe llow.

α Sole partner, and sole part, of all these joys,
Dearsr thyself than all; needs must the Power
That made us, and for us this ample world,

Be infinitely good, and of his good ·

hs liberal and free as infinite;

That rais’d us from the dust, and plao'd us here
ln all this happiness, who at his hand

Have nothing merited, nor can perform

Aught whereof he hath need, he who requires
From us no other service than to keep

This one, this easy charge3 ol all the trees

In Paradise, that bear delicious fruit

So various, not to taste that only tres

Of knowledge, planted hy the tree of life;

So near grows death to lile, whate'or death is,
Some dreadful thing no doubt ε for well thou know'st
God hath pronouno'd it death to taste that tree,
,the only sign of our obedience left,

Among so many signs of power and rule
Conlerr’d upon us, and dominion given

Over all other creaturos that possess

Earth, air, and, sea. Then let us not think hard
One easy prohibition, who enjoy

Free leave so large to all things else, and choise
Unlimited of manifold delights :
