304 PARADISE LOST, B. IV.
ugho on a heap of nitrous powder, laid

Fit for the tun, some magazine to store

hgainsta rumour'd war, the smutty grain
With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the air:

Ι So started up in his own shape the fiend.

Beck stept those two fair angers, half amaz’d
So sudden to behold the grisly king;

Yet thus, unmov’d with sear,‘accost him soon.

α Which of those rebel spirits adjug'd to hell
Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison? and, transform’d,
Why sat'st thou like an enemy in weit,

Here watching ¹at the head of these that sleep? »

u Know ye not then, ( said Satan, fill'd with soom)
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate

For you, there sitting where ye durst not soar ε
Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,

The lowest of your throng3 or if ye know,

Why ask ye, and superfluous begin

Your message. like to end as much in vain? n

To whom thus Zephon, enswering seorn with scorn·

«Thinlr not, revolted spiritsthy shepe the seme,

Or undiminish'd brightness to‘be known,

hs when thou stood'st in heaven upright and pure;
That glory then, when thou no more wast good,
Departed from thee, and thou resemblest now

Thy sin and place of doom, obscure and foul.

But come, for thou, besum, ehalt give acoount
