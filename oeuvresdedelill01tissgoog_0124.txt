114- PARADISE roso, Β. 11.

By soree impooeihle, by leave obteiu'd
Unacceptable, though in Hoeven, our state

Os , splendid vassalage3 but rather seek

Our own good from ourselves‚ and from our own
Live to ourselves, though in this vast recesS, Ι
Free‚ and ιο none accountable, preferring Ἴ
Herd liberty before the easy yoke

Os servile pomp.

Our greetness will appear
Then most conspicuous3 when great things ofsmall,
Useful of hurtful‚ prosperous of adverse
We can ereete3 and in what place so e'er
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pairh

Through labour and endurance. This deep world
Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst

Thick clouds and darlr doth Heaven’s all-ruhing Sire

Choose to resjde, hie ghory unobscur’d,
And with the¹ majest] os darkness round
Covers hie throne; from whenee deep thunders roar

Mustering their roge, and Hoeven resemhhes nell?

hs he our darkness, cannot we his light
Imitate when we please? This desert soil
Wants not her hidden lustro, geme and gold3

Nor want we skill or art, stom whence toraise · ’
