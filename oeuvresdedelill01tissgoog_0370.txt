To whom tho patriarch oi mankind replied-
«Ο favourahle spirit, propitious guest,

' well hast thou taught the way that might direct
Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set
From centre to circumference3 whei‘eon,

ln contemplation of created things,

By steps we may ascend to God. But say,
What meant that cantion join’d, Is γι befocrtd
Obedient? Can we want obedience then

To him, or possibly his love desert,

Who form’d us from the duat, and plac’d us here
rutt rothe utmoet measure of what hliss

Human desines ean seek or apprehendi»

To whom the angel: ι Son oi heaven and earth,
Attend: That thou art happy, owe to God;
That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,

That is to thy ohedience3 therein stand.
This was that cantion given thee3 be adris’d.

God made‘thae perfect, not immutahle3

And good he made thee, hut to persevera ·
He lest it in thy power3 ordain'd thy wiii
By nature free, not over-rul'd by sate
Inextricahle, or strict necessity:

Our voluntary service he requires,
Not our necessitated3 such with him

Finds no acceptante, nor can find3 for how

Can heerts, not free, he tried whether they serve
Willing or 110, who will hot what they must

By destiny, and can no other choosei‘
