Magnificence; and what can heaven show more?
Our torments also may in 'length of time
Becorne o'ur elements3 'these piercing fires
hs soft as now severe, our temper chang'd
Into their temper3 which must needs remove
The sensiblc of pain. All things invite
To peaceful counsels, and the settled state
Of order, how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils, with regard
Of what we are, and where3 disrnissing quite
All thoughts of war, Ye have whatl advise. ν’
He scarce had finish'd, when such murmur fill’d
The’ assembly, as when hollow rocks retain
The sound osblustering winde, which all night long
Had rous’d thesea, now with hoars'e cadence lull

Seafaring men o’er·watch'd, whose bark by chance

Or pinnece anchors in a craggy hay

After the tempest. Such applause was heard
As Mammon endcd3 and his sentence pleas’d‚
hdvising peace a for such another field

They dreaded worse than Hell: so much the sear '
Of thunder and the sword of Michael

Wrought still within thern3 and no less desire
¹To found this nether empire, which might rise
By policy‚ and long process oi tiore,

In emulation opposite to Heaven.
