Then os their session ended they bid cry

With trumpets' regal sound the great result.

Toward the four winde four speedy Cherubim

Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy,

By herald's voice explain'd; the hollow abyss

Heard far and wide, and all the host of Hell

With deafening shout return'd them loud acclaim.
Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat rais'd

By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers

Disband, and wandering, each his several way

Parenos, es inclination or sad choice

Leads him perplex'd, where he may likeliest find

Truee to his restless thoughts, and entertain

The irksome hours, till his great chief return,
Part on the plain, or in the air sublime,

Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,

, hs at the’ Olympian gamos or Pythian fields3 ’
Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal
With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form,

As when, to warn proud cities, war appears

Wag'd in the troubled sky, and armies rush
To battle in the clouds, before each van
Prick forth the aery knights, and conch their spears
