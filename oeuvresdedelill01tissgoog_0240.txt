230 PARADISE LOST, B. 111.

tlt those his works so wondrous he ordain'd‚

Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim

Alone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, tell

ln which 01 all these shining¹ orbs hath Man

His fixed seat, or fixed seat heth none,

But all these shining orbs his choico to dwell;

That ΙΙ may find him, and with secret gaze

Or open admiration him behold,

On whom the great Creator hath bostow’d

Worlds, and on whom heth att these grates pour’d;

That both in him and all things, as is meet,

The universal Muker we may praise;

Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes

To deepest Holl, and, to repair that loss,

Created this new happy race of Men,

To serve him better: wise are all his waysln Ι
So spelte the false dissembler unperceiv’d3

For neither man nor angel 000 discern

Hypoerisy3 the only evil· that walks

lnvisible, except to God alone,

By'his permissive will, through Heavon and Eorthz

And oft, though Wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps

ht Wisdom’s gete, and to simplicity

Resigns her charge, while Goodness thinks no ill

Where no ill seems: which now for once heguil'd

Unel, though regent 01 the Sun, and held

The sharpest·sighted spirit 01 01110 Heaven:

Who to the fraudulont impostor 1001,
10 his uprightness, answer thus return'd.
