And Powers that ¹eust iu, Heaven seton thrones ς·
Though of their names in heavenly records now,

Be no memorial; hlotted out and ras'd

By their rebellion, hom the books oflife.

Nor had they yet among the sons of Ere

Got them new names, till, wandering o’er the earth,
Through God's high sufferanee lor theftrial of, man,
By felsities and lies the greatest part

of mankind they corrupted to forsake

God their Creator, ond the' invisible

Glory of him· that mode them, to transform

'Olt to the image ofe brute, edorn'd

With gay religions tull· of pomp and gold,

And devils to adore lor deities :1

Then were they known to men hy various nomes,¹ ·

And various idols through the lleethen world. .

Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last,
Rous’d from tho slumber, on that fiery conch,
Ἀι their great emperor's call, as nertin worth
Came singly where he stood on the borestrond, ·
While the promisouous crowd stood yet eloof.

The chief were those, who, from the‘ pit· of Helt,
Roeming ιο seek their prey on earth, durst fix
Their scats long alter next the seat ol God,

Their altars by his alter3 gods edor'd
Among the nations round; and durst ahide
Jehovah thundering ont of Sion, thron'd
Between the Cherubim ·, yen, osten plao'd
