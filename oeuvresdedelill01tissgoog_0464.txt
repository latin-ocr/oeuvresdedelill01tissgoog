Not to destroy, but root them out of heavent

The overthrown he rais'd, and es a herd

Of goats οι* timorous ssock together through,
Drove them before him thunderetruck, pursued 2
With terrore, end with furies, to the hounds

And crystal weil of heavcn; which, opening wide,
Roll'd inward, and a spacious gap disclos'd

Into the wasteful deep3 the monstrous sight
Struck them with horror heckwmd, but far worse
Urg’d them behind3 headiong themselves they threw
Down from the verge of heaven3 eternal wrath
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.

Heli heard the' unsufferabie noise,¹ hell saw
Heaven ruining from heaven, and would have ssed
hffrighted3 but strict fate had cast too deep
Her dark inundatione, and too feet had bound.
Nine days they fell: confounded chaos roer'd‚
And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
Through his wild anarchy, so huge a tout,
lncumber'd him with cuin: hcll at last
Yawning receiv'd them whole, and on them clos'd;
Heil their fit habitetion, fraught with fire
Unquenchahle, the house os woe and pain.
Disburdcn'd heaven rejoic'd, and soon repair'd

Her murel hreach‚ returning whence it roll’d.
