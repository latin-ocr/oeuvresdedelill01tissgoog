210 PARADISE LosT, B. IV.

Sometimes towards heaven, and the full-blazing sun,
Which now sat high in his meridien towcr.
Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began:

a Ο thou, that, with surpassing glory crown'd,

Look'st from thy sole dominion like the God
'of this new world, at whose sight all the stare
Hide their diminish’d heads; to thee 1 cali,

But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,
Ο sun ! to tell thee how 1 hate thy beams,

Thai bring tomy remembrance from what state
Ι fell, how gioricus once above thy sphcre3

Till pride and worse ambition threw me down ,

- Warring in heaven 'against heaven’s matchicss king:

Ah,' wherefore ! he deserv'd no such return
From me, whom he created what I was

ln that bright eminence‚ and with his good
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.

What could be less, than to afiord him pmice,
The easiest recompense, and pay him ehanks ,

How due ! yetall his good prov'd ill in me,
