hs when a gryphon, through the wildemess ’

“ With winged nonme, o'er hill or moory dale,

Pursues the haimespian, who hy stealth
Had from his waheful custody purloin'd

The guarded gold: eo eagerly the Fiend ‚
O'er hog, or steep, through streis, rough‚ dense, or rare,

With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,
And swims, or siuks, or wades, or cresus, or tiesz

ht length a universal hubbub wild

’ Of stunningsounds, and voices all confus'd,

Borne through the hollow dash, anantes his eur
With leudest vehemenoe: thither he plis,
Undaunted to meet there wintever Pouet·

Or Spirit of the netharmost ah'yss

Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
Bordering on light3 when straight behold the throne Ἴ
Of Chaos, and hisdarh pavilion spread

Wide on the wasteful deep; with him entitron'd
§aemule-vested Night, eldest uf things,
