326 PARADISE LOST, B. V. ,
And, as l wondering look’d, beside it stood

One shap’d and wing’d like one of those from heaven
By us oft seen3 his dewy looks distill'd
Ambrosia3 on that tree he also gaz’d3

And, Ο fair plant, (said he) with fruit surcharg'd,
Deigns none to ease thy load, and teste thy sweet;
Nor God, nor man? Is knowledge so despis'd?
Or envy, or what reserva forbids to teste?

Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold
Longer thy offer’d good; why else set here?

This saida he peus'd not, but nith venturous ann
lle pluek'd‚ he tested3 me damp horror ohill'd‚
tt such bold words vouoh'd with e deed so bold:
But he thus, overjoy'd a-O fruit divine!

Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus crept,
Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit

For Gods, yet able to make Gods of men:

tud why not Gods ol men; since good, the more
Communieated, more abundant grows,

The author not impeir’d‚ but honour’d more?
Here, happy creature, fair angelis Eve!

Partake thonals03 happy though thou art,
Happier thou may'st be, worthier canat not be:
Teste this, and be henoeforth among the Gods
Thyself a'goddess, not to earth eonfin’d‚ '
But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes

hseend to heaven, by merit thine, and see
