Father, to see thy lace, wherein no cloud
Of anger shall remain, hut peace assur'd

and reconcilement3 wrath shall he no more

Thenceforth, hut in thy presence joy entire.»

His words here ended, hut his meek aspect
Silena yet spake, and hreath’d immortal love

To mortal men, above which only shone ἱ
Filial obedienee: as a sacrifice

Glad to he oller’d , he attends the will
Oi his great Father. Admiration seiz'd
all heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend,
Wondering3 but soon the’ Almighty thus replied:
« Ο thou in heaven and earth the only peace

Found out for mankind under wrathl Ο thou
Ι My sole complacence! well thou know’st how dear

To me are all my werke, norman the least,
Though last created3 that fort him l spere
Thee from my hosom and right hand, to save,
By losing thee awhile, the whole raoe lost.
Thou, therefore, whom thou only eanst redeam,
Their nature also to thy nature join3 Ἴ
And he thyself man among men on earth,
Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed,
By wondrous birth: he thou in Adam's room
The head of all mankind, though Adam’s son.
hs in him perish all men, so in thee,

hs sroma second root, shall be restor'd
