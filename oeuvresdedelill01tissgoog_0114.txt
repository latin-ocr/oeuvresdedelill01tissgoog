'rim’rous aud slothsul: yet he pieas’d the ear,
And with permanire necent thus hegen ε

α 1 should be much for open war, Ο peers,
As not behind in hate3 if what was urg’d
Mein reason to persuade immediate war,
Did not dissuade me most, aud seem to cast
Ominous conjecture on the whole sunonem
When he, who most excels in fect traina,
ln what he manuele, and in what excels,
Mistrustful, grounds his eourage ou despair
And utter dissolution‚ as the scope
of all is aim, after some dire revenge.
First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are fill'd
With armed watch‚ that render all acoess
Impregnable ε ost ou the bordering deep
Encamp their legious; or, with obsoune πίῃς,
Scout far and wide into the renlm of night,
Seorning surprise. Or could we break our way
By force, aud ut our heels all Heli should rise

With blackestirrsurrection, to confound
Heayen’s purest light r yet our great enemy

Ι All incorruptible, would on his throne .

Sit unpolluted‚ and the' ethereal mouid,
lncapuhle os stain, woidd soon expel
Her mischief, aud purge off the haser dre,

Victorious. Thus repuis’d, our final hope
