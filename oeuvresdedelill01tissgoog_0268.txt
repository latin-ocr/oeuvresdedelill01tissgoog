258 PARthSE LOST, Β. lv.
Thus was this place

Α happy rural seat of various view,

Groves whose rich trees wept od'rous gums and halin,
Others whose fruit, burnish’d with golden rind‚
Hung amiable, Hesperien lables true,

lf true, here only, and ofdelicious taste:

Betwixt them lawm, or level downs, and {looks
Grazing the tender herb, were interpos’d;

Or palmy hilloelr3 or the llowery lap

Of some irriguous valley spread her store‚
Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose:
Another side, umbrageous grots and caves

Of oool recess‚ o’er which the mantling vine

Lays forth her purple grape‚ and gently ereeps
Luxuriant3 meanwhile murmuring waters fell
Down the slope hills‚ dispers’d, or in a lake, '
That to the fringed bank with myrtle orown'd

Her crystal mirror holds, unite their streams'.

The birds their quire apply; ains, vernal airs,
Brenthing the smell ol field and grove, attone
The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,

Knit with the Grecos and the Hours in danee,

Led on the' eternal spring. Not that fair field

Of Enna, where Proserpine gethering llowers‚
Herselfa fairer llower‚ by gloomy Dis
Was gether’d which eost Ceres all that pain
