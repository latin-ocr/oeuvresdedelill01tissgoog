401 PARADISE LOST‚ B. Vh

Them whom he governs. This is servitude,

To serve the' unwise, 01 him who heth rebell'd
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
Thyself not free, but 10 thyself enthrall'd;

Yet levvdly dar's‘t the our minist'ring upbraid.
Reign thou in 11011, thy kingdom3 let 1110 00110

In heaven God ever blest, andhis divine

Behests obey, worthiest to 110 obey'd3 ’

Yet chains in hell, not realms, expect: meanwhile
From me return’d, as erst thou saidst, fromflight,

This greeting on thy impious 01001 receive. 1

So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest 1011
On the proud erest of Satan, that no sight,
Nor motion 01 011111 thought, less could his shicld,

Such 111111 intercept : ten paces hugo
He back recoil'd3 the tenth on bended knee
His massy spear upstaid: as if 011 earth

Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,

· Sidolong had push'd a mountain form his scat,

Half sunk with all his pines. Amazement seiz’d

The rebel throncs3 but greater ruge, so sec

Thus foil'd their mightiest, ours joy fill’d ¹and shout,
Presage 01 victory, and fierce desire

¹ 01 battle :whereat Michael bid sound

The* arch-angel trumpet, through 1110 vast 01 heaven
It sounded, and the faithful armies rung
