98 PthDlSE LOST, B. ll.

Of present pain, that with ambitious mind

will covet more. With this advantage then

To union, and firm saith, and firm accord,

More than ean be in Heaven, wenow return

To claim our just inheritance of old,

Surer to prosper than prosperity

Conld have assur’d ns3 and, by what best way,

Whether of open war, or eovert guile, Ι

We now debate: who can advise, may speak. »2
He ceas'd3 and next him Moloch, seepter'd king,

Stood np the strongest and the ‘fieroest spirit

That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair:

His trust was with the’ Eternal to be deem'd

Eqnal in strength3 and rather than ba less ¹

Car'd not to be at all, with that care lost

Went all his sear: os God, or Hell, or worse,

He reek’d not, and these words thereafter spake.
«My sentence is sor open war: of wiles, '

More unexpert, 1 boast not: thern let those

Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.

For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest,

Millions that stand in arms, ad longing wait

The signal to ascend, sit lingering here,

' Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place

Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame,
The prison of his tyranny who reigns
' By our delay? No, letus rather choose,

Arm'd with Heli-flames and fury, all at once,

Q'er Heavtn's high towers to force resistless way,
