ιη PARADISE host, o. 11.

Made head against lleaven⁴s king, though overthrowii.
l saw and heard t for such a numerous host

Fled not in silence through the frighted deep,

With ruin upon ruin, root on tout,

Confusion worse eonfounded3 and heaven-gates
Poor’d out by millions her victorious hands

Pursuing. l upo'n my frontiers here

Keep residence τ ifall Iean will serve

· That little which is left so to defend,¹

Encroaeh’tl on still through your intestine broile,
weakening the seeptro of old nght :first Hell,
Your dungeon‚ stretching far and widebeneeth3

Δ Now lately heaven, and Barth, another world,

llung o’er my realm, link’d io a golden chain

To that side lleaven from whence ,your legions fell..

1f that way be your walk, you have not far3
So much the nearer danger3 go, and speed l

flav'oe, and spoil‚ and roin are my gain. ι)

He oeas’d3 and Satan staid not to neply
But, glad thet now his sea should find tt shores
With trost alacrity, and foroe renew’d,
Springs upwarhtlike a pyramid of fite,
