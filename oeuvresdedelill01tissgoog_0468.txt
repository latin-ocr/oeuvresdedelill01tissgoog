Bereav'd of happiness, thou may’st partake
His punishmmt, eterna! misery3

Which would he all hh eolace and revenge,

As a despite done against the Most High,
Thea once to gain companion of his woe.

But listen not his temptations3 warn

Thy weaker: let it profit thee to' have heard,
By terrihle example, the reward

of disobedience3 firm they might have stood,
Yet fell 3, rememher, and faur aa transgaessa
