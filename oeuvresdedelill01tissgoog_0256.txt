246 PthDlSE LOST, Β. lV.

For never can true reconcilement grow,

Where wounds of deadly hate have piere’d so deep ι

Which would but lead me to a worse relapse

hnd beavier sall : so should 1 purchase dear

Short intermission bought with double smart.

This knows my punisher3 therefore as far

From granting he, asl from begging peace :

All hope excluded thus, behold, instead

Of us out-cast, exil’d, his new delight,

Mankind created, au for him this world.

So farewell hope, and with hope farewell sear,

Farewell remorse t all good to me is lost:

Eril, be thou my goodt by thee at least

nicaea empse with navens mng i hou

By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign3

hs man, ere long, and this new world shall know. υ
Thus while he spake, each passion dimm’d his face,

· Thrice chang'd with pale ire, enwy, and despair3

Which marr'd his borrow’d visage, and betray’d

Him counterfeit, if any eye heheld:

For heavenly miuds from such distempers loul

hrc ever cleer.⁴ Whereof he soon aware,

Each perturbation smooth'd with outwerd calm,

Artifieer of freud3 and was the first

That practis’d falsehood under saintly show,

Deep malice to conceal, couch’d with revenge:

Yet not enough had prietis’d to deceive

Uriel once wam’d3 whose eye pursued him down

The way he went, and on the’ Assyriae mount
